LPT: if a friend or a family member gets diagnosed with dementia or alzheimer, in the early stages try to find out what their favorite songs of all time are. In this way you would be able to create a playlist for them that could be of great benefit in the later stages of the disease.*****Music helps dementia patient recall memories and emotions. Especially when specific songs are connected to previous parts of their lives.
LPT: If you like one song by an artist, but don't dig the rest of their stuff. find out who the producer is and see what other work they've done. The producer can play a big role in how the final song turns out.*****Edit 1:Woo, front page! All from a stoner moment while listening to black keys - weight of love.  Love you all!  Edit 2: Obviously this isn't meant to be a blanket statement or a diss towards black keys. Just a way to maybe find some new music.  Also look into the song writers, or anybody else that was involved with that specific track. 
LPT: Pay Attention to the smell of your home when you come back from a trip - that's what it smells like to guests all the time, you just get used to it.*****Whoa! Front page! And all because I stumbled back in my house, half-asleep and jet lagged from Vegas and noticed my house really smells like my dog. I have so many people to thank! And so many dogs to thank! Like mine, for example.   Edit: Thanks for the gold! And to the rest of you, uh, go Bears and Trubisky is the future.

LPT: for those of you going to college for the first time this month: GO TO CLASS! No matter how hungover, tired, or busy you may be, being present is the most important factor in succeeding in your first year as you adjust to living independently. Missing class is a slippery slope to failing out.*****
LPT: X percent of Y is equal to Y percent of X. So, if you want to find out what 7% of 50 is, you could instead find out what 50% of 7 is, which is 3.5. This means that 7% of 50 is also equal to 3.5.*****More examples: If you want to find out what 2% of 20 is, do 20% of 2 instead and you'll get 0.4. So, 2% of 20 also equals 0.4.   Or, 12% of 25 can be alternatively written out as 25% of 12 instead, which would be  3.   Explanation: Commutative Property. So, 0.07 times 50 will always equal 50 times 0.07.  I hope you found this interesting and/or helpful!   **Edit #1:** Thank you for the gold!   **Edit #2:** You can also solve percentage problems by multiplying the two numbers (7 times 50, which equals 350), and then taking the product and dividing it by 100 (so the answer would be 3.5). Thank you to everyone who pointed out this alternative method.

LPT: If you're trying to explain net neutrality to someone who doesn't understand, compare it to the possibility of the phone company charging you more for calling certain family members or businesses.*****
LPT: Keep inviting that friend who always says no*****If you have a friend or coworker who you have invited to do things with you or your group of friends and they continually decline, don't stop inviting them unless they specifically tell you not to invite them any more. Some folks really would like to be included but really do have other obligations, or maybe they're just super shy and need to be invited several times before they feel like they can work up the courage to go. Or perhaps they are battling depression. Don't give up on that person. You may be just the person they need to get them out of their shell or to eventually become the kind of friend that helps them see the good in life and want to continue going on living. Be awesome  Edit: Thank you for the awards kind strangers!

LPT: if you need somewhere to work/relax with friendly staff, nice AC, plenty of seating, free WiFi, and available all across the US, you’re in luck! There are more public libraries in the US than there are Starbucks or McDonalds! And you’re under no obligation to buy anything to sit there*****[16,568 - Public Libraries in the US. There are over 116,000 if you include academic, school, military, government, corporate, etc](http://libguides.ala.org/numberoflibraries)    [14,606 - Starbucks stores in the U.S. in 2018](https://www.statista.com/statistics/218366/number-of-international-and-us-starbucks-stores/)  [13,905 - McDonald's restaurants in the United States in 2018](https://www.statista.com/statistics/256040/mcdonalds-restaurants-in-north-america/)  Edit: This post got more traction than I was expecting. I’d really like to thank all of the librarians/tax-payers out there who got me to where I am. I grew up in a smallish town of 20k and moved to a bigger suburb later. From elementary school through medical school, libraries have helped me each step of the way.  They’ve had dramatic changes over the years. In high school, only the nerdy kids would go to the library (on top of the senior citizens and young families). A decade later, I can see that the the library has become a place to hang out. It’s become a sort of after school day care for high school kids. Many middle/high school kids have LAN parties. Smaller kids meet up together with their parents to read (and sometimes cry). My library has transformed from a quiet work space to more of a community center over the past decade.  Even though I prefer pin-drop silence, I have no issues with these changes. **It’s better that kids have a positive experience in an academically oriented community environment than be out on the streets, getting into trouble, etc. And putting younger children around books is always a great thing.**  Plus, they have a quiet study room for pin-drop silence people like me!
LPT: If your fire alarm goes off, call your pets and give them a treat. Eventually they will come when the alarm goes off, saving you from wasting time looking for pets during an evacuation.*****Added tip: Deliberately set off the alarm to do more frequent training.  Edit: alarm 'goes off' = alarm sets off = alarm starts. Apologies for use of confusing language.  Not sure yet how to edit title, I'm a bit of a newbie.
LPT: find someone's locked phone? Turn it in to their carrier. They will locate the owner by serial number. This LPT makes you a bro and returns the phone the fastest way to its owner who really just wants the photos. (Talking to you who found my phone in White Mountains, California last weekend)*****
LPT: Keep a separate master resume with ALL previous work experience. When sending out a resume for application, duplicate the file and remove anything that may be irrelevant to the position. You never know when some past experience might become relevant again, and you don’t want to forget about it.*****EDIT: Wow, this blew WAY up. And my first time on the front page too.   I guess I can shut down some of the disagreement by saying that every field does things a little bit differently, but this is what’s worked for me as a soon-to-be college grad, with little truly significant work experience, and wanting to go into education. Most American employers/career help centers I’ve met with suggest keeping it to about a page because employers won’t go over every resume with a fine-toothed comb right away. Anything you find interesting but maybe less important could be brought up in an interview as an aside, perhaps.   A few people have mentioned LaTeX. I use LaTeX often in my math coursework, but I’m not comfortable enough with it outside of mathematical usage for a resume. Pages (on Mac) has been sufficient for me.  As far as LinkedIn go, it’s a less-detailed version of the master document I keep, as far as work experience goes, but I go way more in depth into relevant coursework and proficiencies on LinkedIn than I do on paper.   TL;DR- I’ve never had two people or websites give the same advice about resumes. Everyone’s going to want it different. *Generally* in the US, the physical resume could afford to be shorter because it leaves room for conversation if called for an interview. 
LPT: Greyhound racing is now illegal in Florida after the midterm, which will leave a lot of good dogs in need of homes. If you're considering adopting a dog, please research Greyhounds and see if they'd be right for your family.*****Since this has gained a lot of popularity, I want to add in that anyone with questions should visit the good people of r/Greyhounds.  They can help you decide if you're ready for a retired racer, prepare you for the difficulties that come with adopting one, and clear up any questions you may have about the breed. They can also give you some insight into how retired race dog rescue works. Dogs are a big responsibility that you shouldn't take lightly, but if you prepare yourself and do your research you can face the challenges with confidence.  As many here have said: ALWAYS DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE ADOPTING ANY ANIMAL. ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS!

LPT: If there is anyone at your job you don’t like, always take special care not to take vacation at the same time as them. Having toxic/stressful people gone from the office is like a mini vacation by itself that you would miss out on if you are gone.*****
LPT: Should you ever find yourself homeless, try to get a gym membership.*****Planet fitness is probably the ideal gym. $10/month, they give out free food twice a week, 24 hours, many locations. Even if it's not an option, a gym gives you a place to shit, shower and shave, you'll have a locker to store your things, and you can get out of the elements during rain or extreme heat or cold. If you still have a cell phone, even without a plan most gyms have wifi. It's not going to solve all your problems, but if you can scrape together $10 every month you'll be in a much better position.
LPT: Don't let people guilt you for not visiting them. They're not visiting you either.*****I always feel guilty when people say, "I miss you, you should really come visit me in [city that's a several hour drive away]." It always eases my mind when I remind myself that this person is equally capable of visiting me and isn't doing it either.

LPT: Stop Using Your Address for Lyft/Uber*****I recently had an experience that made me realize why you should not be using your home address as drop off or pickup location. Use the closest intersection.  &#x200B;  I shared a Lyft ride with my female friend. The Lyft driver immediately started hitting on her. When he asked who was being dropped off first, I told him she was first stop. He started berating me for scheduling a ride and having her as first stop, started yelling about why he could not drop me off first.... During his tirade he got lost and when I tried giving him directions he just yelled at me. It was not amusing, it was scary - because now this drunk/high/creepy a-hole knew her address and mine.
LPT: Some tips for buying a used car for people that know nothing about cars*****I’m a mechanic/auto shop owner. I figured I’d put some stuff together for anyone interested in buying a used car but doesn’t know anything about cars. Obviously the best option is to take it to an auto shop to have it thoroughly inspected by a professional before you buy it. The key word here is BEFORE you buy it. I don’t know how many people I’ve had come to my shop for an inspection after they bought it….ugghh. The $150 or so you spend is worth not buying something that may have thousands of dollars of problems. But if that’s not an option, here are some tips to help keep you from buying a lemon:  1-Buy a cheap OBD scanner/reader. You don’t need to spend a lot, as they’ll all do what you need here. A bluetooth OBD reader and the TORQ app for you phone seems to be pretty popular/good choice. Practice using it on some cars. Some of the stuff I'm going over may seem daunting, but if you practice it on a car a few times, you'll get the hang of it, and this will all make sense. You could be saving yourself thousands in repair here, so take a few hours to practice it. It's not hard once you do. You should be able to do all of the stuff I'm going to talk about with your scanner in under 5 mins total. You don’t have to worry about reading and interpreting data. The main thing you want to do is check for codes in the engine and transmission ECUs. ECU stands for Electronic Contrul Unit. Basically, it's the computer that controls the engine or transmission. They are sometimes referred to as ECM, or Engine Control Module, and TCM, or Transmission Control Module. Sometimes they'll be referred to as PCM, or Powertrain Control Module. This is what it's called when only one computer controls both the engine and automatic transmission. The PCM may be one physical computer, but logically, it's 2 computers. So if you connect your scanner to a PCM, you'll still see two separate options, one for engine, and one for transmission. Do note that if you have a manual transmission, there won't be a transmission computer.  So when you connect to each one, there should be no codes in either. If there are codes, there’s an issue. It may be minor, it may be major. Google it if you want, but not knowing what the codes mean, your best bet is to walk away. If your scanner is a better one, you can also check other modules (computers) for codes. However, it’s pretty common on newer cars, especially European, to find obscure codes in obscure modules. Normally they’re not an issue. Focus on the Engine and Transmission. ABS (antilock brakes) and SRS (safety restrain system...airbags, seat belts, etc) modules normally shouldn’t have codes lingering either. Make sure to also check after test driving. The codes may have been reset by the seller to hide a problem (more on that in the next paragraph). They may have returned during your test drive, so check again!  Use the scanner to check the monitors on the engine ECU/Computer. Monitors are a series of self checks that the ECU does on the engine. All applicable monitors should be set (passed/complete). They get reset when you clear the check engine light, or when you disconnect the battery (usually). If all of the monitors haven’t passed, then it’s quite likely the person selling it has reset the check engine light recently (may be trying to hide a problem), or there’s a problem that isn’t allowing the monitor to complete. Not a good sign.  Walk away. To complete all of the monitors can take quite a few miles and sometimes several days. So there's a good window there for you to catch someone doing some hanky panky.  2. Crank the engine without starting it. What you want to do is listen to the engine during a continuous crank. On American cars and on Mazdas, this is easy, as they have what’s known as a Clear Flood Mode. You turn the key to the on position, wait a few seconds, depress the gas pedal all the way, then try to start it. The engine will crank away without starting for as long as you hold the key (or in the case of a push button start, until you hit the button again). If the engine starts, quickly let off the gas so you don’t revv up the engine too high and try it again. You’ll want to listen to it for a good 10 seconds or so. This is a very easy way to check compression on an engine. The main thing you hear when cranking an engine is the electric starter working to try and spin the engine. As a piston comes up and compresses the air, the starter has to work harder to spin the engine, and the speed/pitch of the starter changes. Once the piston comes back down, it’s easier to spin the engine, so the speed/pitch changes back, and then repeats as each consecutive piston moves up in the compression stroke. Every engine sounds different, but they all should have a very steady rhythmic starting noise. Kind of a WAAA WAAA WAAA WAAA WAAA. If one or more of the cylinders has low compression, you will hear the starter have an off-rhythmic sound that repeats. So for instance, if you have a 4 cylinder engine with one low compression cylinder, it would sound like WAAA WAAA WA WAAA WAAA WAAA WA WAAA WAAA WAAA WA WAAA etc. Every 4th pitch change will sound different than the other 3.  For reference, here’s what a normal cranking sound should be: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v0h\_Ygqox0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v0h_Ygqox0)  Here’s what a low compression cylinder cranking sounds like. It’s at about :55 secs :[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOghpmVhVng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOghpmVhVng)  If you listen closely, you’ll hear the unsteady rhythm. Loss of compression is usually piston rings, valves, or head gasket. All costly. If the engine sounds funny when cranking, walk away.  If the car you’re looking at doesn’t have a clear flood mode, you can remove the fuel pump relay in the engine compartment fuse box, which turns off the fuel pump. Most cars have one, but some don’t. Some cars can be a real PITA to disable it from starting. Google the car you’re looking at with something like “YYYY Make Model clear flood” or  “YYYY Make Model disable fuel pump” and see if there’s an easy way to achieve this. I'm sure there will be a Youtube video showing you exactly how to do this.  Practice this beforehand on cars you have access to if possible to tune your ear to the sound. You can also do this periodically on your own car to see if any problems are arising.  3. Check the fluids. All of the fluids will have minimum/maximum marks. If fluids are low, someone has not been maintaining the car well, or it has developed a leak. Not a good sign. When checking the engine oil, it should range from clear to black. If it looks like chocolate milkshake, there is a major problem. RUN AWAY. You can also smell the oil on the dipstick to see if it smells like gasoline. If it smells like raw gasoline, the engine is either injecting way too much fuel or you have bad piston rings. Either way they're bad. If the oil level is WAY above the full mark, like an inch or more, then either some other fluid is making it's way into the engine (very bad) or someone sucks at doing an oil change. Remember to check the oil with the engine off and on level ground. Some new cars don’t have dipsticks (mainly European). If so, you’re SOL. Check the coolant in the reservoir. It should be green, pink, red, yellow, orange, blue, or purple, depending on manufacturer. If it’s rusty, walk away. Remove the radiator cap (only if the engine is cold) and look at the cap and in the radiator. If you see any rust or chunky/gritty brown stuff, walk away. If it’s just water, walk away (be careful here, Ford’s yellow coolant almost looks clear). Check the automatic transmission fluid. For the most part, it should be red, but sometimes amber or green. It may be black. That’s dirty. Not a deal breaker, but they haven’t been keeping up on maintenance. It should not smell burnt, though. That’s bad. If it looks like strawberry milkshake, that’s really bad. Also, remember that you should check the level on automatic transmissions while the engine is running in Park and after driving it and getting the transmission good and hot. The only exception is most Hondas. That’s checked after driving but with the engine off. Google it for the car you plan on looking at to make sure. Many new cars don’t have a transmission dipsticks, so again, you’re SOL there.  4. Start the engine and listen for any noises. The engine should be cold. If it’s at operating temperature, the seller may have warmed it up to hide some cold start engine noises. Be wary. If it makes any noises, walk away.  5. Look for maintenance records. If it has consistent oil change records at an oil change place, at least they’ve been changing the oil. Unfortunately, oil change places only check easy profitable stuff. It’s better than nothing, though. If the records are all at an independent shop, that’s better. Indy’s will usually do a pretty thorough check up on the car when servicing it. If it has all dealer records, that’s the holy grail. Dealers will find any nick nack that’s wrong and upsell it. They also commonly don’t do thorough diagnostics (this is an unfortunate effect of the way dealer shops operate). So if it needed repairs, on top of having new parts that needed replacing, it may have other new parts that it didn’t even need. Plus those new parts will be good quality OEM parts, not chines junk of questionable quality.  6. Check that everything works on the car. Check the A/C, the heater, the windows, the locks, the mirrors, the head/parking/brake lights, etc. If the owner neglected to fix obvious problems, what else did they decide not to fix?  7. Look under the hood and look for any hokey work. Random zip ties holding things on, tape, broken plastic pieces, a battery that can move around if you push on it, wires hanging, etc. If it looks like unprofessional work has been done on what you can see, how bad is what you can’t see?  8. How does the car look? Is it dirty, full of scratches, stained? If the owner cares so little about the interior/exterior, they probably have the same attitude towards the mechanical part of it.  9. Check the tires. Aside from general condition, do they all match? If all the tires are different, they’re cheap/broke, and have probably cheaped out on a lot more than just tires. Lay your hand flat on the tire tread and light feel around the tires. If you feel a repeating pattern of flat spots/dips, you have suspension problems.  10. Try and stay away from used car dealers. Used car dealers get the majority of their cars from auctions. A lot of cars that go to auction are sent there by someone that doesn’t want it, usually because there are problems. Not all, but many. New car dealers send trade-ins that are too old or the wrong make to put on their lot, and some of those are decent. However, the small used car dealers usually buy the bottom of the barrel cars at auction. They’ll fix the minimum needed with the cheapest parts possible to maximize profit. They’ll make it look pretty, though. Good chance you’re buying a polished turd. Not all used car dealers are bad, though. Check reviews. Look at what they have on the lot. If they have a lot of high resale value cars on the lot, they're buying the good stuff at acution. If all of their cars are under $10k, with a lot under $5k, move on.  11. Obviously, test drive the car. Drive it at different speeds up to highway speeds. Brake easy, brake hard. Find a crappy road or railroad tracks to drive over. Make sure there are no noises or vibrations. Get it good and warm. When you’re done, open the hood and take a good whiff. Make sure there are no strong smells (like burning fluids or other things). Look under the car and see if anything is dripping or the bottom of the engine is covered in fluids (bring a flashlight, it can get dark under there). Don’t be alarmed if you see water dripping under the car at about the same area as the base of the windshield/firewall. If the A/C or defroster was on, that is just condensate from the A/C system. Touch it. If it’s not oily and looks/feels like water, it should be OK. If you’re test driving a manual car, the clutch engagement point should be somewhere in the middle of the clutch pedal travel. If it’s right at the top or right at the bottom, clutch repairs are in the near future.  12. This one is a little more advanced, but not too difficult. It’s also pretty important. You’ll need your OBD scanner. What you want to do is look at the engine data and search for the fuel trims. An engine computer injects fuel based on a bunch of sensor inputs. It has a base fuel map programmed into it that it references, based on those sensor inputs, and injects XXX amount of fuel. There is an oxygen sensor in the exhaust system that analyzes the exhaust gas and acts like a quality control inspector. It tells the computer whether it injected too much or too little fuel. The computer then makes adjustments to that base fuel map to make sure it’s injecting the proper amount of fuel. Those adjustments are called fuel trims. A 5% fuel trim would mean the computer had to add 5% more fuel than the base map. A -5% fuel trim would mean that the computer had to reduce fuel by 5% from the base fuel map. In a perfect world, fuel trims would be zero. However, that’s rarely the case. Fuel quality, different atmospheric conditions, engine wear, engine or sensor problems, etc, make it so that the base fuel map is never perfect, so the computer is always adding or subtracting fuel (usually it’s adding, but sometimes it’s subtracting). I don’t like to see a computer adding or subtracting more than 10% fuel. Any more than that and there may be a problem. Any more than 15-20% and there is definitely a problem.  So what you’re going to want to do is look at the data on the engine computer. You want to make sure you connect to the computer using the GENERIC OBD2 option on your scanner. Different car manufacturers will call these fuel trims by different names, and display the percentage in different ways. If you connect to the engine computer the standard way, you may be confused trying to find and read the fuel trims. But if you connect using the generic obd option, it’s always going to use a standardized display format across all vehicles. Some really cheap OBD scanners only connect using the generic OBD protocol. You’re going to see a long list of a bunch of different data. Scroll through until you find “short term fuel trim” and “long term fuel trim”. I'm not going to explain what the difference between those two data parameters are, as that doesn't matter here, and may end up being confusing. I'm just going to tell you what to do with the values you see.  Short term fuel trim, depending on your scanner, may be displayed as: Short term fuel trim, STFT, ST, or ST%  Long term fuel trim may be displayed as: Long Term Fuel Trim, LTFT, LT, or LT%  Let’s assume your scanner uses the more common STFT and LTFT designation. You’re going to see a number after the letters, so STFT1 and LTFT1. The number means the “bank” or side of the engine. A 4 cylinder engine only has one “side” so you’ll only see STFT1 and LTFT1. However, a V6 or V8 engine has two sides of the engine (3 or 4 cylinders on one side, and 3 or 4 cylinder on the other side, hence the V6 or V8). The computer controls fuel independently for each side of the engine, so you’ll see a STFT1 and LTFT1 for one side of the engine, and STFT2 and LTFT2 for the other side. Don’t be alarmed if you’re looking at a V6 or V8 engine and you only see STFT1 and LTFT1. Many late 90s cars and some early 2000s cars didn’t control fuel separately for each side of the engine, and lumped both sides into one bank.  When looking at the short term and long term fuel trims, you’ll notice the long term fuel trim number stays pretty steady, but the short term fuel trim number may change a lot. This is normal. What is important to note is that they are cumulative. So if STFT=4 and LTFT=3, then your total fuel trim is 7%. Let’s take a look at some examples on a V8:  STFT1 : 3 ...  STFT2 : 6  LTFT1 : 2 ...  LTFT2  : 1  So the total fuel trim on bank 1 is 5% (3+2) and the total fuel trim on bank 2 is 7% (6+1). Each bank is below +/- 10%. That’s pretty good.  STFT1 : -5 ...  STFT2  : 3  LTFT1 : 3 ...   LTFT2  : 1  Bank 1 fuel trim is -2% (-5 +3) and bank 2 is 4% (3+1). Again, that’s good.  STFT1 :  6 ...  STFT2 :  7  LTFT1  : 10  ... LTFT2  :15  Bank 1 fuel trim is 16% (6+10) and bank 2 is 22% (7+15). That’s not good. Walk away from this one.  Here's one more that's a littlte different:  STFT1  : -20 ...  STFT2  : -20  LTFT1  :  22 ...  LTFT2  : 20  Hey, 2% and 0% total fuel trim on each bank. SWEET! this car is running almost perfect! Well not really. Why is the LTFT adding 22% but then the STFT is taking  a bunch of it back? There may be an intermittent issue going on here. So add the absolute values together as well (treat -20 as 20) and see what that total is. Here we have 42 and 40. There's some interpretation required here that you'd need some experience to do, but I'd say anything over 25 when adding absolutes is cause for concern.  Check these numbers with the engine running at idle, and rev up the engine and hold it at about 2500rpms and check it there. Like I said, you may see the STFT number change pretty quickly, so just use the average of the numbers you see for that one. If you have someone with you, you can have them check the numbers while you drive as well.  Practice this on a car you have access to beforehand.  13. Last and not least, don’t trust the person selling the car. Trust your eyes, your ears, and your instinct. You don’t know this person, they may be lying about the car, or try and tell you that the thing you’re worried about is no big deal, it’s just this or that. Or they had a guy check it out and it’s a really easy/quick fix. Be patient and find the right car. If something is fishy or doesn’t seem right, move on to the next car. A car is a pretty big expense. Most people budget for the purchase price of a car and don’t consider there may be considerable extra expense in fixing major problems. Minimize the possibility of those extra expenses by inspecting the car the best you can.  I would recommend running through these things, and any others you want to add, on your current car, your parents’ cars, friends’ cars, etc. Do it several times. Get comfortable in making these checks so that when you’re doing them in front of some stranger on their car, you won’t forget anything.  &#x200B;  EDIT7 - I'm putting this above my other edits so it gets seen. I totally forgot to talk about Titles and their pitfalls. u/BossMaverick has made an excellent post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/egs81p/lpt_some_tips_for_buying_a_used_car_for_people/fcc67tp/?context=3) talking about it, and a few other good things as well.  &#x200B;  EDIT- Forgot another tip regarding possible accident repairs. When you look under the hood, the color of the metal in the engine compartment area should be the same color as the car. If you see different colors or primer, it's had body repair. Also, if you look at the reflection in the car's exterior paint up close and at an angle, you'll notice that the reflection has a wavy pattern to it. That's called orange peel. Every car has it from the factory, except super high end cars. The orange peel pattern should be consistent all the way around the car. If the pattern changes in certain parts of the car, it's been repainted in that area. Good chance it had an accident. Another thing you can do is take a small magnet with you. You're going to place the magnet against the car in as many areas as you can. Make sure you wrap it in a microfiber towel or something  soft so you don't scratch the car (it's not your car). The magnet should attract itself to the body and even stick to it. If there are spots where the magnet doesn't stick as strong or at all, there is body filler there. It's had body work. Do keep in mind that some body panels aren't magnetic on some cars. If you can't get the magnet to stick anywhere on an entire panel (like the fender or hood) then you probably have a non magnetic body panel (maybe fiberglass or aluminum). I guess it's possible that the whole body panel is covered in bondo, but that would be rare, as that would be an extremely poor repair.  &#x200B;  EDIT2 - Fixed some formatting  &#x200B;  EDIT3 - Thanks for all the replies and awards.

No need to even sign into the new address because all the confirmation emails go straight to your normal account that you are already logged into.  Edit: Apparently you can add anything you want after the plus sign, so you can do Bob+netflix or bob+netflix1, or whatever! Thanks for the additional tip u/PM_ME_A_PLANE_TICKET

LPT: if your child does something (like cleaning) out of the norm, don't ridicule them for it. Positively reinforce it.*****When I was younger, I got to the age where I started helping out. I can't remember exactly what happened the first time, but I think I cleaned up the house (5 kids, 2 adults, big house) because my parents needed that extra bit of help. Instead of "hey, thanks for helping out" the end. I got "what's wrong with you? Did you bump your head or something" and I remember one time I was washing up, my mum called for "everyone come quick" because I was doing the washing up and it'll never happen again so take a look whilst you can.  Even now, as an adult, if she's over and I get the hoover out she'll say "are you feeling alright" and my sister now says it too.  It makes me so uncomfortable that I have to clean in private, when my partner is out. I feel like I'm being ridiculed or judged if there is anyone in the house. Then once I've got it perfect if my mum or sister come over they'll say "oh has _fiancé_ been polishing?"  I usually say yes, even though its me that does it and I'm a grown ass adult. But then this further proves them right that I do nothing when in actual fact I do. But the thought of saying I did it makes me feel sick because they'll just poke fun at me.   This has turned into a rant - TLDR don't ridicule someone if they're helping, or they won't want to help again.

LPT: College isn't the only way to start a good career. Apprenticeships, Trade Schools, and Military Training can be great alternatives in today's world.*****The price of four-year universities in the US, among other countries, is huge and growing. There are many situations where the degree is worth the cost, but not for everyone. Obviously if you wish to be a doctor or lawyer, a college degree is inevitable.  If, however, your desired path isn't so rigidly grounded in universities, or you just aren't sure what you'd like to do, take some time to think about alternatives before applying to colleges.  **To high school juniors and seniors:**   Your parents/guardians might be pressuring you to go straight to college because that was practically a guarantee for a good life in their time, but things are different today. If you're going to broach this subject with them, get your sources ready ahead of time. [Here](https://www.thesimpledollar.com/why-you-should-consider-trade-school-instead-of-college/) is a good overview, but you should find other data, analyses, and opinions before fighting that battle.  **Why are skilled trades more relevant now?**  These jobs have been around for a long time, but baby boomers have been over-represented for decades. As that generation retires, demand for skilled trades will be a lot higher than it was twenty years ago. According to [this article](http://www.careerprofiles.info/skilled-trade-worker-shortage.html), 53% of skilled tradespeople are over the age of 45. Anecdotally, I work in an industrial setting with a lot of tradespeople, and almost all the hair here is grey.   **Is there any money in it?**  There definitely can be. Unlike some college-bound fields, you won't likely be making six figures right out the gate, if ever. That doesn't necessarily mean you'll be worse off. Assuming you go the apprenticeship or military routes, you can be making money the day you start, and won't have any crippling debt to deal with. I'd recommend reading up on personal finance for more details on the matter, but if you start contributing to your retirement at 18, even with less income, you could certainly retire with more money than someone who had a higher income, but couldn't contribute until [_ years to complete degree + _ years to pay off debt] later.   That's assuming the college grad can get a job right away. There are plenty of highly educated baristas and retail workers in this country who may never be able to retire thanks to student loan debt. Moreover, one can't get rid of student debt by filing bankruptcy. You're stuck with any loans you take for school.  **What are my options?**  There are a ton of ways to start a career, but I'll talk about a few.  **Apprenticeships** are a great way for experienced tradespeople to pass their hands-on knowledge to pupils that will some day replace them. Apprentices will generally be paid very little at first, but the cheap labor is in exchange for valuable training. Once an apprentice is proficient enough to work on their own, they will generally be making a nice, middle-class wage.   A recent [report](https://www.npr.org/2018/01/04/575114570/robust-apprenticeship-program-key-to-germanys-manufacturing-might) from NPR took a look at how apprenticeships play a part in Germany's industrial success. The US government is also pretty aware of the potential, even if they face challenges in funding programs. The federal program is [here](https://www.dol.gov/apprenticeship/) and you can take advantage of some of their resources in person by finding the nearest [American Job Center](https://www.careeronestop.org/site/american-job-center.aspx)  The federal government is definitely the only organization pushing apprenticeships. In a lot of cases, labor unions organize and administer apprenticeships and training. One example would be the [IBEW](http://www.electricianapprenticehq.com/how-to-join-ibew-apprenticeship/) for electricians, but there are a too many unions that vary from place to place, so I won't bother trying to list a bunch. Searching for unions near your area may be a good place to start identifying other opportunities.  **Trade Schools** can be a good way to get the kind of classroom training you might expect from college, but much more focused and time/cost-efficient. Many community colleges offer trade programs that lead to certifications and associate's degrees. There are also standalone schools that might specialize in a single trade, like welding. [Job Corps](https://www.jobcorps.gov/train) is a national program that can be a good option if a person isn't in a good position to pay for training. It isn't for everyone as I understand it is very structured and somewhat militaristic, but I know a few people who have completed training there and gone on to nice careers.   Training doesn't have to be years long though, especially in the arena of computer sciences, "boot camp" programs are becoming very popular. A computer programming boot camp might be a big expense for such a short program, but its much less expensive than a degree in computer science, and could give you enough tools to land a good job right away or even to work for yourself.  **Military** training can also be a great economic ladder. The pay and benefits are good from the start. Depending on the specialty, the training can be really valuable (and free). Plenty of employers offer some hiring preference to veterans. There are some huge risks associated with this route though, so I would reserve it as a last resort.   Regarding benefits, the basic wage isn't a lot higher than minimum wage, which is often the subject of salty memes. That is not the only income, though. In most cases, living expenses are taken care of, so no need to budget for food, housing, or utilities. That's the bulk of what the working class is trying to stay on top of, so you could plausibly invest every dollar of pay you earn if you didn't have a cell phone or car. Even then, if you are sensible, it would be easy to live below your means. Another huge benefit is free medical for the whole family. On the outside, that would cost a lot.  Regarding training, if you win the "job lottery" you could receive extensive training in a really valuable field. Some people can walk away from four years of service making over $100,000/yr. You could also be a bus driver. You don't really get to choose, and that is the first big risk. I would say it is much better than a 50% chance that the job training you'd get in the military would be worth more than a high school diploma, but if you don't want to be a cop, and they make you a cop, that is a lot of wasted time.  Regarding lifestyle, it can be a great time. I really enjoyed most of the time I spent in the military. There were a lot of people around me who absolutely hated it and had to suffer through a six-year-long mistake. The good stuff is, you're part of a community, you might get travel a lot, you might have really exciting work to do. The bad stuff is, the culture can be very very toxic, you might have to be away from family for years, and being the military, there is an above average chance of being killed, injured, assaulted, or developing a mental illness.  I know that sounds dramatic, but a person shouldn't consider it lightly. In reality though, chances are high that you could walk away with a pretty good financial start and good opportunities to have a satisfying career.   **TL;DR**  If you want to get smart, go to college. If you want a good job, and don't want to become a slave to your own debt, consider a skilled trade.     **Edit:** Based on a lot of comments, it appears that some military branches handle job selection different than others, and these things evolve over time. As a general rule, even if some branch guarantees you a specific job, proceed with caution. Enlisting on an "open" contract is generally a terrible idea, but to clear up some confusion, the AF lets you pick some jobs you want, and requires you to select one of four open aptitudes. "No thanks" is not an open aptitude, but if orders come down for you to enlist "open general", that can be worth thinking long and hard about turning down.   Also about the military, I offered it up as a last resort, and I mean that. Plenty of commentators are saying "DON'T EVER THINK ABOUT JOINING THE MILITARY FOR TRAINING!" I don't know their stories, but there is probably something to it; so many people can't be wrong. You would literally be trading your autonomy up to your life in exchange for a chance for some economic mobility. If you aren't really interested in the military, it's not a great idea.  Regarding ROTC, it is better than nothing. I intentionally didn't mention it though. My philosophy is based on my wife and several other relatives doing ROTC vs my immediate family and I enlisting. If you do ROTC, you have 8 years from starting school to leaving the military. After 8 years, you walk away with at least a bachelors degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. If you enlist, in 4 years you can absolutely attain an associate's and bachelor's degree while you are in if you set your mind to it, especially in the AF, can't say how easy it is in the others. So you walk away with a degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. From a benefits standpoint, you can save yourself some time by back-loading the school. Additionally, I had a way better time than ANY officer I know, and I didn't even like the military. The lifestyles, politics, corruption, and cultures are way different between officers and enlisted. I wouldn't wish my understanding of the officer's life on anyone.  Still relevant to ROTC, but about school in general... A ton of people are very happy and successful thanks to their college education. I'm not out to say they are wrong, but "Go to college if you want a good life!" is neither a compelling nor useful LPT. You have surely gotten that line from someone else already.

LPT: Those viral posts asking things like “Your stripper name is your first pet and your mother’s maiden name” are amazingly effective ways to reveal answers to common security questions you may be using elsewhere.*****The next time you see a mass post or “share this on” message asking for information like this, remember you’re sharing important personal information which may be dangerous to share openly with others. There’s a good reason why so many of them rely on your funny answer being made up of your mother’s maiden name, first pet, favourite teacher or street you grew up on...  Always be careful where you’re sharing information, consider whether it’s really necessary to share it, or consider using incorrect answers - either to the post, or to the security questions themselves (as long as you can remember what you set them to).

LPT: High schoolers, dont think you have to go to college to be successful. Not great at school?, look at learning a trade. You can make a good, sustainable income as an electrician, plumber, welder, etc. You can enroll in a technical college, or better yet find a apprenticeship at a larger company*****Wow didnt think this would blow up over night, thanks for all the advice anyone.  I personally graduated an electrical apprenticeship at a shipyard after failing out of college twice.  I wish I found the apprenticeship straight out of high school, but my school, and I'm sure many others, really pushed you to get a degree.  I now work for a military contractor making a pretty good wage.  I encourage anyone looking to get into an apprenticeship to reach out to their local trade union. Not only will they provide quality OJT, but most places will provide a free college degree like mine did.

Just compete the full process and on the VERY LAST PAGE, there’s a link to click to review all the documents just before you submit.  That shows you each form, completely filled out with all of the correct information. Now with that open, you want to go to the IRS website and use one of their linked sites. Find each form that is on the turbo tax review page you have open, and match all of the fields. Then submit with the other site and exit turbo tax.  You’ve now filed your taxes for free!

LPT: If ever you need a program you want for free (for example a video/photo editor) don't search for "free", search for "open source" to avoid limited trial versions, adverts and malware*****The reasoning being if you type "free", generally you will be advertised to or get the LITE version which will only have some of the functionality and then will be up-sold to.  Open source does what it says on the tin - the code is open for anyone to examine and even adapt and is usually available in-full for free, occasionally accepting donations if you are so inclined.   This has the added bonus of ensuring there are no nasties like crapware or reporting your user history back to their servers etc. because open-source equates to peer-reviewed and open to be examined by anyone.  EDIT: just because it was mentioned, being open source doesn't MEAN that a program is virus-free, but it is a substantially lower risk than closed-source software. Either way, you would be better off with open-source in general.  I am assuming you will be excising a modest amount of caution with what you download by checking it against trusted reviewers/communities.  Edit 2:  As this thread has gained a lot of traction let's address some points: Yes, we know you can torrent a paid-for application. Hilarious as it is for you to keep posting it, you don't need to tell us. Open source is still valid for those of us who believe in privacy, transparency and actually supporting a developer. We are aware of pirating websites, I promise.  Point 2: "Free speech, free beer!"  >usually available in-full for free  >usually  >*usually*  >**usually**   Programs:  >Photoshop = GIMP  >Lightroom = Darktable  >Adobe Illustrator = Inkscape  >Video Editor/3D modeler = Blender  >Video Editor = Kdenlive  >Media Player = VLC (find a video format it can't play, I dare you!)  >Streaming/recording software = OBS  >Windows = Linux - Ubuntu with Cinamon or MATE desktop environment is the most Windows-like, ~~else-wise, there's actually an Open Source Windows called Windows 10 IoT Core (not really for desktop use though)~~ sorry not open source.  >Microsoft Office = LibreOffice  >Food = ha.ha. But it actually exists [in a manner of speaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYB559Is9Y0)  >Minecraft = [actually a thing](https://minecraft.net/en-us/edition/pi/)  >Unzipping program = 7Zip  >Java = OpenJDK (though Oracle Java might be open source anyway)  >Virtualization = there are a few choices, but for non-commercial use, VirtualBox would be the way to go.  >Browser = Chromium (not chrome) or Firefox.  My favourite iTunes alternative is Foobar2000, but I don't believe it's open source. I've heard good things about Audacious, which is, though.  Please remember to support open source software you like with donations if you can swing it - the developers deserve a kickback!

LPT: parents of teens, give your child an innocuous sounding phrase to text you as a code for “get me out of here” when they want to avoid peer pressure but not look like they are bailing/lame*****For example, ours involves our son texting asking if our dog is okay. Then we can come get him and tell him he *needs* to get home. Parents look lame, not the kid.  Edit: whoa, thanks for all the coins and constructive comments and everything!! Never slept through a FP post before!  Couple of generic replies to the more common replies:  - to “why do you need a coded text, nobody else will see it?” - have you never ever had someone looking over your shoulder before? Or you hand your phone to someone for a different use and a text comes in? Etc   - to “don’t teach your kids to be lame, they should stand up to peer pressure” - yes, they should, and that is in fact how we roll. And sometimes it’s really goddamn hard and if they need a backup, they have one.  And considering how tough teenage life is these days, I don’t exactly think it’s teaching them anything other than “I have a parent who cares about my being and might just understand what I have to go through”...
LPT: If you have an ingrown nail, using dental floss will help.*****Doctor showed me this the other day. You slide dental floss under the nail as far as possible and leave a piece on both sides hanging. This will alleviate the pressure and a lot of the pain and after a few days (taking care to change it daily) your nail will start to grow upwards and out of your skin.  Edit: [visual](https://i.redd.it/39j841pg0oc41.png) Courtesy of u/errorcache  Edit 2: Some people only go under the corner that the ingrown is on, it’s a preference thing. Also you just need to put it under the white part of the nail, as well as you can.

LPT: If someone doesn't appreciate something you do for them, it probably means that it isn't that important to them. Rather than stew about it or demand recognition, just add it to the list of things you don't need to do anymore.*****Or, if it just needs to get done, suck it up, buttercup. We don't get gold stars for effort in real life.  An example of what I'm talking about here is that I used to make my husband a cup of coffee and bring it to him every morning. Often he would barely even acknowledge me putting down the coffee much less thank me for it.  At first, this bothered me, how could he not appreciate this nice, loving gesture and getting fresh coffee served to you in the morning?  The answer is that he really doesn't mind making his own coffee and doesn't notice much whether I do it or not. Now I don't bother and it's one less thing on my mind in the morning.  I also noticed that I was organizing a lot of light social events at work - birthday lunches, holiday parties, happy hours, etc. People would come but nobody ever really made a point to say  that they appreciated I was doing it. I stopped bothering most of the time and nobody really noticed and it frees up a lot of my time. Now I only do it if I feel like having drinks out or giving a friend a lunch party.  These are all things *I* would appreciate if someone did *for me* but that doesn't mean everyone else feels the same way.
LPT: if you want to divide something among two people (usually kids), you get one person to divide, and the other person gets first pick on which piece they want. Everyone wins and it ensures the person who divides is fair.*****
LPT: Learn excel. It's one of the most under-appreciated tools within the office environment and rarely used to its full potential*****How to properly use "$" in a formula, the VLookup and HLookup functions, the dynamic tables, and Record Macro.  Learn them, breathe them, and if you're feeling daring and inventive, play around with VBA programming so that you learn how to make your own custom macros.  No need for expensive courses, just Google and tinkering around.  My whole career was turned on its head just because I could create macros and handle excel better than everyone else in the office.  If your job requires you to spend any amount of time on a computer, 99% of the time having an advanced level in excel will save you so much effort (and headaches).
LPT: If someone asks you a question that can be easily googled, please consider the fact that this person might just want to talk with you.*****
LPT: It's cheaper to give yourself a platinum award every month than actually buying Reddit premium*****
LPT: If you make a mistake, admit to the mistake, apologize, and explain what steps you'll take to prevent it from happening again in the future. It's very hard for people to yell at you if you've done that.*****Both professionally and in my personal life, I know a bunch of people that refuse to admit to having made a mistake. When I mess up (and we all do at some point,) I just own up to it right away. By accepting responsibility, apologizing, and saying what I'll do to keep it from happening again, I not only avoid getting a lecture about whatever I did wrong, I also get thanked by my boss/friend/whoever.
LPT: Most modern microwaves have a mute function to turn off the beep. Typically it's by holding 0 for 3 seconds*****Well this blew up. Glad I could help guys.   So I'm seeing that 0 locks some of yours. 0 works on mine. Look at the numbers carefully, one of them should in very small print say "mute", even if it's not the 0. Yours might be the number 1 or 2.
LPT If you have to make a presentation in front of a group of people volunteer to be the first one up as everyone else will be so nervous about their own presentation that they won't pay attention to yours and will more than likely forget any mistake or stupid thing that you might do.*****Forgot a comma. EDIT: ATTENTION! I have received some messages referencing studies done on the primacy effects and recency effects that say that my LPT is scientifically entirely untrue. I will let you decide for yourselves however:  https://www.polleverywhere.com/blog/how-to-structure-a-presentation/ I personally tend to hold the first speaker as the more dominant and would be more forgiving of any mistakes simply for the fact that they took the pressure off of the group. I also would, as I mentioned, be so nervous about my own that I wouldn't be paying much attention to anyone else's presentation until my time came up.  It has definitely been interesting to see both sides of the opinion though.
LPT: take photos of your parents doing things they do every day. When you get older, they will bring back memories more than any posed pic ever could.*****Source:  me, a 50 year old man who can still see his father sitting on the couch, reading the evening paper and drinking a Falstaff after work.  Rest in peace, dad.
LPT: Whenever you travel abroad bring a new soundtrack for each place you visit, preferably one you have never heard before. In the future, every time you listen to each soundtrack again they will bring you vivid memories of the places you have visited.*****
LPT: millennials, when you’re explaining how broke you are to your parents/grandparents, use an inflation calculator. Ask them what year they started working, and then tell them what you make in dollars from back then. It will help them put your situation in perspective.*****Edit: whoo, front page!   Lots of people seem offended at, “explain how broke you are.” That was meant to be a little tongue in cheek, guys. The LPT is for talking about money if someone says, “yeah well I only made $10/hour in the 60s,” or something similar.   it’s just an idea about how to get everyone on the same page.  Edit2: there’s lots of reasons to discuss money with family. It’s not always to beg for money, or to  get into a fight about who had it worse. I have candid conversation about money with my family, and I respect their wisdom and advice. 
LPT: If clothes or towels have a mildew smell, add some plain white vinegar to the washing machine, along with detergent, for the freshest smelling laundry ever. Note: Clothes will NOT smell like vinegar. It is highly diluted as well as going through the rinse cycle. Tried and true. Thanks Grandma!*****To freshen a load of laundry, try 2 cups of distilled white vinegar. For mildew odors you can double and triple this amount. Hot or warm water works best. I have a top loading machine — I let the drum fill with water and put the vinegar in once it fills, right on top of the clothes. I’ve had my washing machine over 10 years and vinegar hasn’t shortened the life of my machine or my laundry for that matter. I have used an entire gallon on kids clothes that came back from summer camp filthy and damp with the worst mildew smell. It also works as a fabric softener. It’s the best. 
LPT: If you get a kitten, DO use your hands for play so you can teach restraint when they are too rough. Restraint is naturally learned in play with hands and littermates because the fun stops when a bite or scratch is too much. Adult cats who didn't play this way are more likely to scratch or bite.*****Obviously this only works if you shout loudly ("OWW!") and stop playing if a bite or scratch is too hard.  I've only been scratched or bitten by cats that weren't properly socialized in this way. Cats that have been socialized this way have always shown amazing skill at not scratching or biting. For example, I have a cat who goes nuts over a hair tie and I can hold it in my hand as the bats at it without fear because she perfectly and expertly keeps her claws in to avoid scratching my hand, even in the fervor of the chase. But once the hair tie is away from my hand, all claws are out.  Similarly, there was I time I had to quickly grab my cat in a way that hurt her, and she had a natural reaction to crane around and bite my hand in her pain, but it was just a gentile mouth touch, even in her distress. This goes for vet visits, holding cats down to take medicine, cleaning wounds, etc. Properly trained cats will have better restraint around bites or scratches, but cats that never learned restraint are more likely to.
LPT: when your ISP raises your bill, call in and say “cancel service” to the automated operator. You’ll be sent to their retention team with no waiting on hold. They will usually take $10-20 off your monthly bill for a year. I do this once a year.*****
LPT: If you have an Android phone, go to the developer options and set Animation Time to x0.5! Your phone will feel like it's gotten a huge processor update.*****Unlock Developer Options:  Settings > About Phone > 7x tap on Build Number   Decrease animation time:  Settings > System > Developer Options > Set all Options with Animation Scale to x0.5 or less  Enjoy your fast phone  Edit: Wow, my first gold, thanks a lot! Glad you guys like the LPT :)  Edit Edit: As others have pointed out, Build Number in Samsung phones is apparently in About Phone > Software info. Also this works on Android devices other than phones.  Edit Edit Edit: The exact options to tweak in Developer options are called Window animation scale, Transition animation scale and Animator duration scale. Alternatively you can also turn the animations off via System > Accessibility > Remove animations!
LPT: Want a good dog? Take them with you everywhere you go. There is a reason that dogs of street people are amazing, and cooped-up condo dogs are hyperactive spaz dogs.*****Ever notice how homeless people who have dogs - their dogs are amazingly calm, follow their owners everywhere?  They have life experience.  They've been out, seen the world a lot, socialized a lot, and just want to follow and hang out with their owners.   If you were kept in a room your whole life, you'd freak and spaz and mis-behave the couple of times a day you were let out too.  (I have been working with dogs for over 20 years)   EDIT:  I should note that no, I don't take them into restaurants to mooch off diners, let them run around on airplanes, or through grocery stores to pee in aisle 6.  I thought that would go without saying, but I guess not.  :)  EDIT:  People on reddit seem to take everything literally.  When I say everywhere I mean everywhere that you can.  Again, I didn't think I needed to specify this doesn't mean 24/7 go to the movies with them, play tennis with them, etc.  ALSO:  NO WARM CARS with the windows up!!
LPT: if an app asks you to rate it click "yes", wait for your app store to start the load then click back. App stores don't state if you share, so apps can't check BUT it stores the cookie and never asks again.*****This saves you clicking "later" and stops the app bugging you with requests:  HTH.   Edit: forgot to mention till reminded... This trick also works for "link to Facebook for a reward" links. Click the link... Wait for Facebook to load then click back. No Facebook link BUT you'll get the reward.  Edit 2: TY for the gold kind stranger.  Edit 3: WOW! third on r/all in 4 hours. You guys are amazing. Thank you.
LPT. Never trust a call FROM your bank. Hang up and call them back at a number you know belongs to your bank.*****Let me start by saying I'm not an* idiot. I usually can spot a scam. Today, I didn't.    So I'm sure this has been said before in some shape, form, and/or fashion, but let me tell you how good these hackers are. Today I received a call from BBT. THE CALL CAME FROM BBT. From their* number I have personally called many times and have saved in my phone as BBT. It was their* fraud department and they wanted to let me know that there is suspicious activity on my account. A few minutes of verifying info and everything was cleared up. My account was locked and a new card was ordered. I was given a 1 time use login and password to re-setup my BBT online account and was told to allow 6-8 hours for everything to take effect.  Or so I thought.    Within a few hours, I was wiped clean. $1.26 left in my bank. So I call BBT back to find out what's going on. I find out that I did not speak to BBT earlier today. I had instead been call spoofed by hackers and that I actually gave them all the info they needed (or better phrased, the last little bit of info they were looking for) to wipe my ass clean of all my money. I talked to the service guy for about 30mins. We hopefully have it official straighten out now. With my account actually locked and a legit new card on the way. There is a chance I may have to get a whole new account period.    The one thing the service guy told me was that if I ever get a call from (my bank) to hang up and call back at a number I know is theirs. If it truly was them, they will know what the call was for. If they have no idea of any reason to call you, you were called by a hacker.   Edit: This has gained a massive amount of traction. I would like to thank this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/ejq9oy/ysk_to_never_trust_a_call_from_your_bank_always/fczynoa?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) for the idea to post it here. It has been interesting reading all the stories. Some with similar outcomes, some with way better outcomes. Either way, it has been a nice topic of discussion.    If nothing else, I hope this post saves at least one other person from going through what I went through.    Edit2: It seems in my slightly frazzled, yet still very amused, state last night, that I missed a few proof reading spots. I appreciate the red pen marks fellow redditors. Keep up the good work.  .   .   .   **************Update*************************   .    .   2 week edit. As it sits right now, the money has been refunded (minus an overdraft fee incurred during the event), new account has been made, new card has been received.       To clear up some misconceptions, here's is some added info.    1. BBT called me. It was not an unknown number. It was BBT's main contact number you can find on the back of your card. I usually do not answer the phone for anyone that isn't family. What led me to answer it that morning was that I had already received a fraud alert text from BBT about 5 mins before. Turns out, that was fake as well. BBT only uses one short code messaging system.    2. I didn't give them any personal info. My SSN was not shared. My account number, routing number, or debit card number was not given out by me. They already had (almost) all the info they needed. My address, my telephone number on file, the email used for my account, the debit card "that was hacked". They used the info they had to tie my card to Google Pay. They only thing they needed was the code that got sent to my phone. Actually 2 codes. One to reset my password for the app, and one to add the card to Google Pay. He played it off that the first code had expired and had to send another one. He said the code was to "lock" the online account so that the fraud could be looked into.    3. This LPT, like many others on here, is not accurate 100% of the time. They can and might call you. They should never make you verify your info. If you read the comments though, it is definitely a great practice if you get suspicious. Hang up and call from a different land line number or a cell phone. Read the comments for more info on the different land line stuff.    4. The amount of money that was taken is kinda irrelevant. $1000 to me, is different then $1000 to you. Or to the guy living paycheck to paycheck. The part that matters is that it was everything I had at the moment. The spending money for a weekend date. Junk food for the kids while we are out on our date. Running money for 2 weeks. You get the idea. All gone. (Luckily, we had gift cards from Xmas and still got our date night.)   5. Lastly, thank you all for all the kind words and reassurances. It did all turn out fine in the end. Lesson was learned.
LPT: Almost everyone who is 'good with money' shares a common trait: they make a detailed budget for the next month and stick to it. If you've never done so, tomorrow (the 31st) is a perfect day to start.*****
LPT: If you have a guest bedroom in your home, spend a night in it yourself to be sure there are no annoyances and that it is comfortable*****
LPT: When flying, put a tag with your info inside your bag, not just outside. Any tag on the outside can come off. Also, when a bag gets lost, the airline will open it to try to determine who it belongs to. Source: Used to work at Lost Baggage for an airline.*****
LPT: When you receive a hospital bill, ask them for an itemized bill and it will be much cheaper*****Example: You get an expensive bill for a $1,000 unfortunately. U.S. healthcare really shouldn’t be so expensive in the first place...but the first thing you should do is call and ask for a review of the level of care, and while on the phone the next thing you do is ask for an itemized bill with every single charge.   They make bills unnecessarily expensive because in the backend of things, they rack up ridiculous charges like $37 for a bandaid. Once you call and request what I’ve mentioned, they’ll knock all the BS charges right off before sending you the itemized statement.   Some bills can go down from $500 to $45. It may not be that drastic for everyone, but many can be reduced by several hundreds of dollars.  If you or anyone you know has been to the ER recently, tell them to try this. It can majorly help!  You can try to even further this by looking for medical debt reconciliation companies. They make money by cutting down on your debt, even in cases like these.  If you have insurance, you can contact your insurance company and ask for a breakdown of what was billed as well.  Most services you were billed for likely weren’t even done. So yes ALWAYS ask for an itemized bill, they get scared and remove a whole bunch of items!  You can also apply for medical financial assistance (MFA). Every hospital has it, you just need to submit financial info and they will pay it all or half. Sometimes you can even get medicine and visits waived for 6 months or more.   Another thing you can do for extra help is ask to apply for charity. The charity department will ask questions about your income situation however, but many people do lie about their income. There’s a chance you’ll get approved and your account is adjusted to zero balance.  EDIT: this may be a bit simplified and there’s some contradictory statements in the comments, but I don’t think you should be discouraged from trying it because it has 100% WORKED for many... such as people in this thread saying it reduced their bill firsthand, hospital employees confirming this, genuine comments on twitter of people sharing their experience with it and how much it lowered their bill, and other videos of people explaining their situation showing gratitude for having learned this info because it saved them a lot of money... no “propaganda” or angrily fueled desire to spread misinformation. Many of these people didn’t get much recognition for sharing their experience either, it’s not like they’re just lying to go viral. They’re not all wrong.
LPT If you think someone has forgotten your name, skip the awkwardness and mention it in third person.*****Last night someone I’ve volunteered with on-and-off for 2 years, I’m pretty sure forgot my name, so I worked into conversation said something like *“I have a tendency to leave things till the last minute, and my roommate is like ‘Alybank! Why are you like this?”* I could see the relief on the other persons face when I said it.
LPT: If you constantly vent your problems to someone, make sure to also call them when things are going well. Good listeners can sometimes get overwhelmed, and it's nice to hear positive news.*****
LPT: Be careful not to let your guard down in conversations with figures of authority when the conversation is informal, friendly, and non-accusatory.*****Thank you for the gold and silver.
LPT: When encountering an a English word with an umlaut (the two little dots), know that it is there to tell the reader to pronounce the second vowel independently of the first. Naïve and the name Zoë are excellent examples of this. An umlaut will never occur over singular vowels.*****
LPT: When an app asks you if you want to leave a review on the apps' store, instead of tapping no, choose yes, wait for it to send you to the review page, then close it: it will think you left a review and won't bother you anymore.*****
LPT: When things go bad at a job, good people leave, eventually followed by people who thought they could change things but got buried because too many good people left. Those left are bad people or hostages. The good people are your canary.*****Brian Hogan posted this on Twitter. I thought it was very simple and profound advice if you’re in a toxic work environment and are considering making a job change. 
LPT: "Who/whom" is the same as "he/him". If you use "who" in a sentence, mentally substitute "he". If you would say "him" instead, then "whom" is the correct pronoun in that case.*****
LPT: If the IRS calls you, it is a scam. The IRS will always start contact you through the US Postal Service.*****
LPT: When you're sitting at a drive-thru speaker, we can always hear everything - even if you think your interaction is over. Be careful what personal details you reveal to strangers.*****As soon as you drive up to the speaker, we get a beep over our headsets and the transmission begins. If we don't answer you right away - we can hear everything. If we apologize and say we'll be with you in a minute - you're not on hold, we can hear everything. If you've ordered but the drive-thru line won't let you pull ahead yet - we can hear every single thing you're saying.   I wish I could forget some of the stuff I've heard.  On the flipside, some of the stuff I've heard has made me give the customer a nice little bonus on their order when it sounds like they need it. 
LPT: If an employer says you have to treat an entry level job as more than just a job to be successful, that's key for you'll be overworked and underpaid.*****
LPT: always assume when you’re put on hold that the other person can still hear you.*****I work at a towing company, sometimes when people call in with damage claims complaints etc. we just mute the call and listen for a minute or two, usually someone slips up to a friend what ACTUALLY happened and we just blow them off/ give them the run around from there. Most calling services listen in while your on hold for training. So mute your side if your going to say something you wouldn’t want the person you trying get a hold of to know.
LPT: 50% of a job is just being friendly to the right people.*****A 'C+' worker becomes an 'A-' with the right attitude. Honestly, in many jobs you could practically skate by just being a delight to your co-workers. 
LPT: If you're directing paramedics to a patient in your house, please don't hold the door. It blocks our path.*****This honestly is the single thing that bystanders do to make my job hardest. Blocking the door can really hamper my access to the patient, when you actually just want to help me.  Context: For every job in my metropolitan ambulance service, I'm carrying at least a cardiac monitor weighing about 10kg, a drug kit in the other hand, and usually also a smaller bag containing other observation gear. For a lot of cases, I'll add more bags: an oxygen kit, a resuscitation kit, an airway bag, sometimes specialised lifting equipment. We carry a lot of stuff, and generally the more I carry, the more concerned I am about the person I'm about to assess.  It's a very natural reflex to welcome someone to your house by holding the door open. The actual effect is to stand in the door frame while I try to squeeze past you with hands full. Then, once I've moved past you, I don't know where to go.  **Instead, it's much more helpful simply to open the door and let me keep it open myself, then simply lead the way.** I don't need free hands to hold the door for myself, and it clears my path to walk in more easily.  Thanks. I love the bystanders who help me every day at work, and I usually make it a habit to shake every individual's hand on a scene and thank them as a leave, when time allows. This change would make it much easier to do my job. I can't speak for other professionals, this might help others too - I imagine actual plumbers carry just as much stuff as people-plumbers.
LPT: Once you’ve already made a mistake, or let someone down, HEAVILY resist the temptation to over-explain, justify, or excuse your actions. Own up to it, offer to make up for it, and move on.*****
LPT: Use https://old.reddit.com/ to browse reddit using the old design. It loads more quickly and it's a bit more intuitive. Assuming everyone knows this, but for those that don't there ya go.*****https://old.reddit.com/
LPT: Don't ask people if they're free on a certain date without specifying why you're asking. Simply asking "are you free on Friday?" comes across like you're tricking the other person into doing whatever it is you want them to do.*****
LPT: often, being liked doesn’t require you to be interesting/funny. It just requires you to make other people feel interesting/funny.*****I’m not saying people never gain pleasure from others being interesting or funny. But the fact is in most interactions, everybody is heavily self-monitoring and will base their judgement of the success of the interaction on how people responded to *them*. If people laughed at their joke. If people found their anecdote interesting or shocking. If people agreed with their opinion.   So the upshot for people who are shy or worry that they’re boring is: you don’t need to put so much pressure on yourself. Honestly most times all you need to do is take an interest in whoever you’re talking to. Listen. Ask questions/follow-up questions. Laugh at their jokes. And they’ll come out of it thinking you were a really cool person to talk to, when actually what they mean is you made *them* feel like a really cool person to talk to.   Edit: for those saying isn’t this just ego-stroking or being fake, it’s not about sucking up to the other person at all. It’s just empowering you to worry less about what you’re saying, because the other person is almost certainly experiencing you in terms of how you respond to what they say anyway.   Edit again: no I’ve never read How To Win Friends and Influence People but I think I’ll have to after this haha
LPT: When making conversation with someone you've just met, ask them what they've been listening to lately, rather than what their favorite kind of music is - it's fresh in their mind and they won't have to pick favorites on the spot.*****
LPT: Before telling your landlord you're moving, ask them to fix anything broken that you're worried you might get charged for. They often will, and then when you move out they won't be able to take it out of your security deposit.*****
LPT: When stressing over something, use the 10-10-10 rule. Will it matter in 10 days? 10 months? 10 years? After getting some perspective, you’ll notice how very few things end up worth stressing over.*****Credit goes to my mom for teaching me this one. 
LPT: treat your ears nicely. Ears don't repair themselves and earplugs to concerts are better than tinnitus for the rest of your life.*****
LPT: When you break a glass on a hard floor, shine a flashlight parallel to the floor so you can see the shadows of tiny pieces you would otherwise miss.*****
LPT: If Word crashes or shuts down and your document didn't save, search ".asd" in the file Explorer under "This/My PC". It should be there.*****
LPT: When you spill wine on fabric (clothing, carpet, couch). Dab it carefully with a paper towel to absorb most of the liquid, then pour salt over the remaining stain. The next day, the salt will have absorbed most the wine and you just vacuum it up. This has saved me tons of permanent wine stains!*****
LPT - When you're about to cry, think of words that rhyme or count backwards from 100 in sevens. Engaging the logic part of your brain shifts bloodflow away from your emotional centers and helps you maintain your composure.*****I read this in the book "Moody Bitches" by Julie Holland, if that's relevant.   Edit: I absolutely support people expressing emotion in healthy ways, and I encourage all people to cry when they need to, in whatever context. That's up to an individual person to decide. I just wanted to clarify that this advice is directed at people who have made the decision to hold off on crying until another time, for whatever personal reason, not to discourage people from crying.
LPT: If you’re working in a technical role (IT, Engineering, etc), write everything you do down as if it was a user manual. Ignore those who say it will be used to replace you. It is far more likely to be used to show management “you can give me that promotion, as the next guy is all set”.*****It’s also going to help build skills in communicating things clearly, precisely and in a way anybody can understand. You’ll also be amazed how many times writing something out instructionally can lead you to think “wait, why do we do it like that?!” - identifying opportunities for improvement.  Edit - wow, lots of comments - both positive and negative. For some extra help / elucidation:  -	I found this very helpful when I was starting my career. The biggest part not being the sharing of knowledge, but the act of setting it out “on paper” to better see where things need to change, where I didn’t know all I could know, and where others may struggle in the future. -	I am indeed now a director. Our company is quite small, but we have had engineers come and go and move on to amazing things, both internally and externally. It’s those who communicated and shared knowledge who moved the furthest; I can honestly say my proudest achievement is knowing some of my employees are now in amazing roles in other firms. As a manager, it’s a sign that you gave them the right challenge, the opportunity to grow, and the confidence to see they can do more. I’m never sad to see someone go elsewhere if it’s because they’ve found a better opportunity - it means you were a crucial part of them making a success for themselves. -	Most importantly, where I’m from, there are employment laws in place to ensure if someone is fired because they’ve been forced to “work themselves out of a job” then they can sue for constructive dismissal. I know some managers look for ways around this, but generally here it’s not a common motif. As such, I do agree that if you’re in a country like India, China, USA, where some of these protections and freedoms aren’t so readily available, it is better to tread with caution in terms of sharing information. In others, like Germany, UK, most of Scandinavia, the culture is very different, and going above and beyond to communicate and help others can be well received.  But yes, as with anything - this has been an experience I’ve personally found valuable and looking from the other side can see why, but always think about how it applies to your situation. I guess as a second tip - if you’re working for a company where you feel the management are always trying to find ways to screw you over, maybe it’s time to find a new company to work for...
LPT: If a server or cashier at a restaurant gives you extra of something for no charge, and you are later asked by a manager if that employee was doing their job well, don't mention that they gave you extra food. It could potentially get them in trouble.*****Edit: I posted at lunch and just got home from school to find this. This is the most polarized comment section I have ever seen. I'm so sorry
LPT: Act like your future self is a real person. So when you see a chore that needs to be done, you can say "I'll do this now to be nice to my future self". Helps motivate to get things done because you're doing work for someone you want to help.*****
LPT: If you want to learn a new language, figure out the 100 most frequently used words and start with them. Those words make up about 50% of everyday speech, and should be a very solid basis.*****
LPT: Don't ask a veteran if they ever killed someone. It is both the first and worst thing a veteran gets asked about*****THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE.  TL/DR:  Don’t Ask
LPT: An agrument is when you are trying to determine WHO is right, a conversation is when you are trying to determine WHAT is right.*****In the business world we should all be having conversations, however in my experience this is very rarely the case, mostly it is arguments. So how do you change this? The first step is to point out the above. Ultimately this entire situation is caused by the ego, a universal variable most managers never take into account. Try to separate yourself from your idea and present it in a way that is purely beneficial to the company, if you do this enough times your ego will eventually be rewarded.  Edit: Agrument...I know...believe me when I say it is irritating me more than it could possibly irritate you :)
LPT: Buy yourself a good pillow. You use it every night and the difference between a good pillow and a stack of cheap ones is almost immediately noticeable.*****
LPT: Getting angry with people for making mistakes doesn't teach them not to make mistakes, it just teaches them to hide them.*****
LPT: The best thing you can ever do for a box cake mix is use real butter instead of oil, milk instead of water, and add one extra egg.*****The difference those 3 small changes make in terms of moisture and texture is amazing. Turn that $2 box mix into a $100 professional bakery dupe and no one but you has to know.  Edit: since this has blown up beyond anything I could have expected, I feel the need to address a couple of things. There are about 1000 of you screaming "just make it from scratch!" and y'all are missing the point. Whether you love it or hate it, box cake mix is a thing, and they're extremely popular. Millions of people use them all the time. They use them because they're easy, inexpensive, and accessible. There are 8 billion people on this planet and not everyone knows how to bake. Not everyone wants to learn, or can even afford to. And that's ok. But for a lot of people, box cake mix is a great jumping off point. All I did was mention a couple of easy things to improve on that that people might not know *because maybe no one had told them before now.* Some of y'all are getting awful snobby about cheap cake and it's not a good look.   Second, a bunch of people have suggested other things to jazz up cake mix, from instant pudding and applesauce to coffee and even soda. And you know what? That's fantastic! If you have something that makes baking easier or makes a cake that you think is delicious, then do it! You bake that cake! Baking should be enjoyable, and if it's delicious then why does it matter how you get there? Everyone has to start somewhere so play around with it, experiment, learn what you like, and what works for you. Have fun with it. It's just cake.

LPT: iOS has an option to turn off apps asking to rate them*****Like me most of you are probably sick of playing a free game then a pop up appears asking to rate the app? Apple have put in an option to turn this off (asking to rate is automatically on by default) so they can’t ask you anymore. To turn this off on iOS 11, go to settings and tap ‘account’ at the top then ‘iTunes and app store’ at the bottom there’s an option to turn off in-app reviews.  Edit: this is still in beta and is a new feature by Apple. Companies had to put in rating notifications for themselves before but Apple are phasing out apps being able to do there own in app review notifications and replacing it with this Apple feature which you can turn off.

LPT TIPS: What you should never to bring to a dry cleaners*****I owned a dry cleaners for 5 years, and before that, used to work in one for 10 years, both front and back end. I know the whole process. I'm going to spill the secrets on garments you should never bring to a dry cleaners because you are being ripped off.  EDIT: Disclaimer: My experience in the business may not be necessarily reflective of ALL dry cleaners so take that into consideration.  DOWN JACKETS -  Down items are expensive. It could cost $40 to have a down coat cleaned. Down items have to be washed by themselves, lest they spill feathers onto other items, so that's why they're so expensive, to ensure profit from the isolated load. Down coats are rarely dry-cleaned, but laundered, and then hung to dry overnight, and then placed in a dryer for a few minutes to plump out the feathers, and good to go. Down items are not pressed. You could wash a down jacket yourself, hang it to dry, and get the same processing  COMFORTERS - Never bring a comforter to a dry cleaner unless it specifically says "dry-clean only."  Dry cleaner owners won't dry clean a comforter unless they have to, because it's cheaper to launder. Comforters can range from $39.99 or higher and you're getting less quality than you would at a laundromat. Comforters are rarely ever spotted for stains, and they're laundered in a basic commercial wash machine with a standard setting, hung to dry over night to save on drying time, then placed in the commercial dryer, and then finished. If your comforter had any bad odor before you brought it in, it probably is still going to have that odor. You're better off paying $5 at a laundromat, and choosing your own cycle and spin settings.  SPOT-CLEAN ONLY DRESSES - Many customers don't check or understand their care labels, and dry cleaners love that. Some formal dresses are "spot-clean only", which means, it can't be washed in the conventional way.  It might fancy sequins glued to the fabric, which dry cleaning will melt and damage the dress. Dry cleaning is oil-based and will melt glue and plastic. Dry cleaners may charge you up to $30-50 due to the fanciness of the dress, when they can't even clean it. They may go over the spots and individually spot and treat them, or, at best, hand wash the item by soaking it in cold water, and hang drying overnight, nothing you can't do at home. Again, with the fancy sequins, the item typically can't be pressed.  WEDDING DRESSES - Wedding dressed could cost up to $200 even though they are dry cleaned the same way as a $6 pair of pants, but, if you bring a wedding dress, NEVER opt for the preservation box. Dresses are more if you get the preservation box, which adds $50 or more to the cost - but dry cleaners DO NOT press wedding dresses that get placed in the box, which is typically there for an indefinite period. By the time the customers opens it 3 years later to notice it isn't pressed, it's too late to take back to the cleaners for a redo.  So you're paying more money for the dress WITHOUT the pressing. You get more for your money if you buy the preservation box elsewhere, and put it in there yourself after you get your dress cleaned and pressed.  LEATHER: Leather is the most expensive item to clean, around $50 for a coat, but dry cleaners rarely ever do leather on premises, but send it out to a third party leather cleaner. So you're paying more than what the dry cleaner pays to have it cleaned. Also, there is no special Leather dry cleaning method. Leather is simply lightly spot cleaned with a dish-soap leather formula and then hung to air dry in a moisture-free environment overnight. You're essentially just paying for the labor charge. To save money, you could lightly go over the jacket yourself with Dawn soap, water, and a microfiber towel.  &#x200B;  WORTH IT:  MEN'S BUTTON-UP SHIRTS - Men's shirts only cost around $1.25-$2 a shirt, They're laundered by the bulk and then heat-pressed on their own machine in less than 20 seconds. Dry cleaners don't make their money off of this, so it's a great value to the customer.  WOOL PEACOATS - Wool peacoat are notorious for getting lint on them, and they're dry-clean only. Counter employees will often remove the lint by scraping and shaving the fabric so it looks much nicer at pick-up.  D/C Only items - suits, silk shirts, cashmere sweaters, etc.  Oil/grease spill - Dry cleaning is oil-based and will absorb oils on fabric such as food, yellow body perspiration, motor oil, that water can't get. If you get oil on your fabric, it's worth it to request dry cleaning at a dry cleaners. It's especially great for removing the yellow body oil stains around the armpit and collar areas.  Also want to add the benefit of opting for"press only."  Baseball/hockey jerseys cannot be dry-cleaned as it will melt the logos. They are laundered. However they do look nice when pressed. So you could save money by washing items like jerseys and Polo golf shirts yourself and then bringing them in for "press only" if its the pressing you like - and save a few euros off the price.  Bottom-line: To get the most of your money, if you drop something off at the dry cleaners, make sure it can benefit from the professional-grade pressing.  If your item cannot be pressed, you are often paying more for an item you could be doing yourself.

LPT: When you get a new notebook, leave the first page blank. When you finish using the notebook, you can number the pages and use the first page as a table of contents.*****
LPT: Teach yourself to not touch your face throughout the day - you’ll get sick less, as hand to face/mouth contact is one of the most common routes for microbial transmission.*****EDIT: Some information to prevent myself from having to facepalm in response to some of these comments.  For a complete overview of the pathogenesis of the rhinovirus (a virus responsible for the majority of cold and flu-like illnesses) check out [this article](https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1513/pats.201006-039RN). Some key excerpts are: - “The most common way to ‘‘catch a cold’’ is to pick up a rhinovirus with the fingertip and introduce it into the eye or nose.” - “It is possible to avoid catching a new cold by paying close attention to the hands. Not touching the eyes or nose with the fingers will decrease the risk of infection.”  Hence, this LPT. It’s based on the well documented phenomenon of self-inoculation. Washing one’s hands is still the gold standard. However, the vast majority of people are not washing their hands especially often. Conversely, people are constantly touching their faces, essentially subconsciously. Therefore, to reduce the risk of transmission/self-inoculation, stop touching your face (particularly around your eyes).   The study "Protective Effect of Hand-Washing and Good Hygienic Habits Against Seasonal Influenza: A Case-Control Study." specifically concludes that "infrequent touching [of] the eyes, nose, or mouth with ones hands" led to a "substantially lower risk of community-acquired influenza infection" (frequent hand washing and getting the flu vaccine were also associated with substantially lower risk).   In the article "Medical myth busting: Separating fact from fiction about colds and flu" from the Fred Hutch, Dr. Steve Pergam (member of the Vaccine an Infectious Disease Division there) says things like: - "To infect someone, these particles don’t have to be breathed in, they just have to get into any mucosal surface — eyes, mouth or nose. . . Stop touching your face!" - "Your hands touch elevator buttons, public transport rails, all the different places you go on a daily basis, then you touch your face hundreds of times a day. I have a bottle of hand gel with me at all times.  You can’t stop yourself all the time, but be more aware of whether your hands are clean before you start rubbing your eyes."  A 1982 study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology titled "TRANSMISSION OF EXPERIMENTAL RHINOVIRUS INFECTION BY CONTAMINATED SURFACES" found that in a controlled setting, when healthy adults touched a surface contaminated with rhinovirus and then touched their face, up to 56% of them became infected.   The 2015 study "Survival of rhinoviruses on human fingers" states "person-to-person transmission is most likely due to the contamination of hands by the nasal secretions of the infected person passed to a susceptible individual, either directly to the fingers or via an environmental intermediary; infection then follows from self-inoculation to the upper nasal airways or eyes." and subsequently cites four more studies as supporting evidence.  I could go on and on but I think at this point it's on the Redditor to do their own reading.
LPT: If you pack a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for yourself or someone else to eat, put peanut butter on both slices before adding jelly. It prevents the other slice from absorbing the kelly and getting mushy.*****Jelly instead of kelly. Unless you're into women named kelly covered in peanut butter. I wont judge.  *kelly has joined the chat*
LPT: If you're taking your animal to the vet for an ailment, get video of them coughing, breathing strangely, limping, etc. Animals may not show the ailment at the vet's office and the video can help the vet diagnose your furry friend.*****It also can save you multiple trips to the vet.  Edit: Was not expecting this to blow up this much! I do need to give credit to my own vet for suggesting I do this when I brought my cat in and he wouldn't cough and hack like I was claiming he was doing... jerk...  Also, a lot of people recommend to record illness episodes to show Dr's and a lot of other suggestions for warranties and such.  And, of course, thanks for the gold and silver, internet strangers!
LPT: pack your toiletry bag the night prior to traveling and only use that travel bag when getting ready the morning that begins your travels. This way, you will identify anything you may not have packed the night before and will have time to add it to your toiletry bag before setting off.*****
LPT: As a manager, give praise in public and give discipline in private.*****In an old job in "Corporate America" I had a manager who would always share with employees encouragement and kind words of praise within earshot of other employees, and would offer words of critisicm and suggestions for improvement in private (in his office or a conference room). This set up an environment of positive reinforcement and gave employees respect and honesty they needed to perform at a higher level.   Edit: Good call by /u/slumdawg11b for pointing out that this applies to any leadership role, and /u/airforcefalco that it applies to parenting.    Edit 2: Lots of folks rightfully expressing that this is a catch-all method and knowing your employees' personally to effectively give praise and discipline is the best way to go.
LPT: When browsing en.wikipedia.org, you can replace "en" with "simple" to bring up simple English wikipedia, where everything is explained like you're five.*****simple.wikipedia.org 
LPT: If you’ve got some free time and you’re planning on spending it watching tv/playing video games, etc. make yourself go on a short walk or do some brief exercise beforehand. You’ll probably end up going longer than you planned and you’ll feel better about relaxing after.*****
LPT: when making nachos, put a tortilla underneath your chips to turn leftover toppings into a taco.*****Also helps with cleanup (no cheese stuck to plate).  Edit: RIP Inbox!  Glad so many of you enjoyed my LPT!  And thank you for the golds, kind strangers--may you always pick the nacho stuck to other nachos (after all, it's still one nacho). 
LPT: If you’re trying to eat healthier or lose fat, after buying fresh fruits or veggies, pick/cut/wash them asap for healthier snacking and quicker availability. The tendency when snacking is to grab-and-eat rather than taking time to fully prepare. Unhealthy food can be too conveniently available.*****
LPT: If someone tells you about an event in their life coming up, add it to your calendar. So you can follow up with them after no matter how big or small it is. Makes you a better friend.*****
LPT: Instead of sending flowers to a funeral, give them pictures and videos of their loved ones that they may not have copies of.*****This is a heartfelt move especially if they didn't take many pictures as a family and it may let them see a side of their loved one they didn't know about.
LPT: Go for a walk every day.

LPT: Get a blank book and have each family member over 50 write down the life advice they'd want their descendants in 500 years to know. Keep adding to it and passing it down. You now have a family heirloom that won't be pawned off for drug money, and will only get more useful as time goes on.*****Something I started for my own family around last year, which I think more people should do.  Call it a heirloom book or something.  Asking for advice that'll be useful so far into the future ensures that it'll be timeless, and gives people a chance to pass on their wisdom and be remembered long after they would otherwise be forgotten.  You can fill it with all sorts of stuff, from stories to family recipes to general LPTs.  Make extra copies whenever you have to pass it down to multiple children, too.
Lpt: Don't take unsolicited advice personally. Most of the time the person giving the advice is giving advice they wish they had, not advice they think you need.*****
LPT: Don't put your life on hold waiting for closure on something you're struggling with. Many of life's most difficult situations don't have reasonable explanations.*****
LPT: For those in flooded areas, use extreme caution when walking on streets and sidewalks. Manhole covers are often forced off by the flood and can be extremely dangerous as people can fall in, get trapped, and drown.*****I’m from New Orleans where flooding is common. Rising water in sewers offen moves manhole covers(openings to the sewer) creating a very dangerous situation especially when water is being pumped through the sewers (as in during a flood). It creates underground rivers and people fall in and drown.   Use a boat whenever possible while crossing flooded urban areas and use extreme caution when walking.  Another thing to consider are keeping food, water and an axe with you if forced to move to a higher level of your home. Many people got stuck and even drowned in their attics during katrina but the people who brought axes could cut through to their roofs.
LPT: If you're a highschool student looking for a job and are eventually planning on moving to a new city after graduating, aim for a job at a large chain like a grocery store. They will often facilitate job transfers so that you can have employment lined up when you move*****
LPT: Reddit can be just as addicting, and mentally damaging as other social media. Take a step back every once in a while*****Lets be real, Reddit can be quite repetitive, frustrating, and sometimes straight up depressing (especially if you follow the news and politics closely), so it's nice to take a step back and leave it for a while. I think that it helps me, especially around this time of year, to connect with the people close to me.  I'm not saying to quit Reddit forever, it's a great site. But a break can do you some good.  Edit: I’m surprised that so many people actually agree with this, but it makes me feel more sane knowing that I guess haha. Think I’ll take my own advice and leave Reddit for a while. Thanks for all the comments!
LPT: When at the beach, always beware the area where the waves don't crash. It often signals a rip current.*****> Edit : Since this is getting some visibility, I want everyone to know that this post doesn't explain all the dangers of rip currents, nor does it depict how they exactly appear all the time. i just wanted to share a side of the danger that may be interesting to be careful about. The most important thing to keep in mind is to **not try to fight back against the current**, **swim sidewides to break out of it**. Rip currents are not always like the areas mentionned in the title. Also, I'm not the most knowledgeable on the subject, please read about it on specialised websites.  People often think that an area where the waves are not crashing down is safer, since the ocean seems calm. However the lack of waves is often due to a rip current that will pull you away from the shore, and a lot of people die trying to fight it, not being aware of its presence.  It is way easier to see with [an image](http://cdn1.theinertia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/rip.jpg). If you get caught, **don't fight it**, either **let yourself drift away and swin around it** once you've stabilised, or **break free from the current by swimming perpendicularly to it**.  A friend of mine died getting caught in a rip current last Saturday. Awareness literally saves life.
LPT: If you want to offer a deep and memorable compliment, ask someone how they did something. It gives them the opportunity to tell their story, and shows your genuine interest.*****
LPT: If someone doesn't understand something you're explaining to them, treat it as your fault for failing to explain effectively, not their fault for not understanding.*****I've recently realized this is the root of most of the communication issues with my friends and family. I would try to explain something, for example: how to run the new dishwasher. If they failed to understand the process, I would get angry (not at them, just in general) and they would see it as a critique of their intelligence. The discussion would quickly turn into an argument and in the end everyone would just hate the new dishwasher.   So I started acting like it was my failure to explain the situation...even if it wasn't. It totally changed the tone of my voice and made the person I was talking to more receptive to my instructions. Instead of turning into an argument or debate, it turns into a constructive teaching opportunity.   
LPT: If you ever want to cancel a subscription and they allow you to select a reason why, always pick the "it's too expensive" or "I can't afford it right now" option. Odds are they will give you a discount incentive to stay or later on send you an opportunity to try them out again for free.*****
LPT: When hosting a dinner party for people you're not familiar with, leave a simple task until they have arrived, like mixing salad ingredients, or slicing bread. Invariably your guests will ask if they can help, and you can point them to these tasks as a useful icebreaker.*****
LPT: Instead of buying a card to go with a child's present get an inexpensive book and write your message inside the cover. It will become part of the gift while still doing what a greeting card would.*****
LPT: If a company has a chat feature, chat with a representative instead of calling. Then save your chat transcript. That way you have written proof in the even a company tries to screw you over about a service.*****Had to use this against Mediacom to stop them from applying “Tech-Fees” and “One-Time-Charges” to my bill. 
LPTs: Chrome extensions I wish I knew of back when I started college.*****As I am about to enter my grad school I have been looking for ways to enhance my productivity to make my experience go by easier. As a result, I recently started exploring Chrome extensions, and man I wish I had done this earlier. Some will no longer be of use to me but I hope it can help others.   [**Cite This For Me: Web Citer**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cite-this-for-me-web-cite/nnnmhgkokpalnmbeighfomegjfkklkle?hl=en) This one hurts me a bit as my days with MLA, APA, Harvard, and Chicago are coming to an end. The extension adds a button to the top of your browser that you simply click, and it will automatically site whatever website or article you are on. From my experimentation with it, it seems to work just as well as EasyBib or any of those other sites and it is much faster to go through.  [**Google Dictionary**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-dictionary-by-goog/mgijmajocgfcbeboacabfgobmjgjcoja?hl=en) If you get this extension, you will have no excuse to not know a word that is on a article or text book (online). It's very simple, double-click or highlight over a word you don't know and it will define it for you. I imagine any science or legal majors will love this one in particular.   [**Grammarly for Chrome**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen?hl=en) I often use bad grammar and I know it. This extension gives me shit for it all the time, but it helps. It highlights grammatical or spelling errors for you anywhere and allows you to quickly correct it.   [**Readability**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/readability/oknpjjbmpnndlpmnhmekjpocelpnlfdi?hl=en) This extension simply aims to trim the fat off of articles to provide you with the main point. I would not trust it for anything in depth, but if you are running low on time and need to skim an article I'd give this a shot.   [**SpeakIt!**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/speakit/pgeolalilifpodheeocdmbhehgnkkbak?hl=en-US)  I know I can't be the only lazy shit who sometimes does not want to actually use my eyes to read text books or articles. This app lets you highlight over text, you click a button, and a pleasant voice reads it to you as you browse reddit. Or I guess you could take notes as you listen too...  It works in several different languages and accents (if you somehow understand German-English accents over the default one). You can also control the speed that it talks to you in words per minute. I could see myself playing it out loud randomly just to try and feed the information into my brain, but I would still recommend reading like a normal person every once in a while too.   [**Block & Focus**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-focus/dcpbedhdekgkhigjgmlcbmcjoeaebbfm?hl=en)  Type in the websites that distract you *cough* and let this thing keep you away. Manage your workflow and control when you take breaks and when you work. There are others like this one and they are all probably worth a shot.   [**MolView**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/molview/nogcacamdkipgkfpfiakaoamdnihinnm?hl=en)  I haven't tested this one out but it looks amazing for those who are in O-Chem or higher. It allows you to draw up molecules and look at them 3 dimensionally. I was one of those losers that bought an actual molecule set for $40 to understand what I'm looking at, so this might save you money if you have trouble visualizing molecules.  **Bonus Tips That I Learned**   ***Make a folder on your bookmark tab, and slide all of your nonproductive websites in there.*** Leave a bookmark for any of your online school based websites. It will be hard but it has helped me stay away from time wasting sites.   ***Use [sleepyti.me](http://sleepyti.me/) for your late night studies or binges.*** It's a simple interface that aims to synch you up with your rem cycles for the best sleep possible. I cannot say it works every time, but this site has saved me some cranky days as I stayed up too late studying.   ***Use [RainyMood](https://rainymood.com/) to destress yourself.*** I'm sure many of you know about it but I love this one.  I'm sure I have missed a lot of good extensions and tips. Feel free to tell me any I should try out!   **Use [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) to dim your PC screen to prevent eye strain and help you fall asleep** -Credit to KreekyBonez for that one!  Good luck in your studies my friends! _________________________________________________________________________ EDIT: Cleaned up the post and added the links to the extensions. Also added Flu.x per KreekyBonez as it is one I think people should be aware of.  _________________________________________________________________________ EDIT: Thanks for the love guys, this blew up way more than I expected! Glad to help. Wanted to mention a few things after reading through many of your comments.  I hope that most of you know to still be careful with your grammar and citations. It isn't really that different from the autocorrect for word and easy bib. **Always double check your writing if it is an important paper, especially with citations**. But if you're like me you can use it for the basics and check over the formatting after the fact. Just wanted to throw that out there as many Redditors have been commenting on those two extensions. Otherwise thanks for all the suggestions and upvotes of course! 
LPT: When lending a pen or marker hand it over without the cap, you are much more likely to get it back*****
LPT: Considering upgrading your living situation but not sure you can handle the increase of cost? Try “paying” the new amount, and put the difference in a savings account.*****For instance, say you’re currently paying $1,000 a month for rent and considering moving to a bigger place that’s going to be $1,500. Pay your $1,000 rent and put the additional $500 into a savings account. *Do this for at least 3 months*. Sometimes your budget numbers will work on paper but once you start buying Dunkins and Taco Bell you’ll find you don’t have as much left over as you thought.
LPT: If a friend is buying you lunch and you are wondering what price or how much is okay, ask him what he recommends.*****
LPT: When starting a new change in your life such as going to the gym or quitting smoking, avoid telling friends or family. Their positive feedback can give you a false feeling of accomplishment tricking you into thinking you have already succeeded which can hinder your efforts to change.*****I read an article about this several years ago and it has helped me tremendously.  I can't find the original article I read, but here is a good one from Psychology Today:  https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/ulterior-motives/200905/if-you-want-succeed-don-t-tell-anyone  Edit: Thank you Redditor for finding the original article that I read! - http://berkeleysciencereview.com/when-telling-others-about-your-goals-compromises-them/
LPT: Don’t donate platinum awards, donate koala bears as they give $2.50 cents for Australian fire relief.*****Edit: If you have money, donate directly to the fire relief organizations, don’t spend money on Reddit coins to give koala awards.  They are koalas not koala bears, I am very sorry for the mistake.
LPT: If you believe your employer may be discriminating against you when it comes to pay, do not be afraid to ask your coworkers what they make. It is a federally protected right to speak about salary.*****In the USA, since 1935, there has been a federal law that prohibits any company in the private sector (and as of 2014, also the federal sector and federal contractors) from discriminating or terminating an employee for sharing their salary with others.  Keep in mind, there are certain positions that are specifically excluded from this law: - Workers in religious schools (they must follow the school's rules)    - Agricultural Laborers    - Airline employees    - Supervisors (who aren't classed as "employees" for this purpose)   - Independent Contractors   While it may not be specifically stated in the law, positions in Human Resources or financial positions may also be prohibited from speaking about pay in certain instances, since they often handle money.   Keep in mind, that while an employer can not stop you from talking about your salary in general, they are within their right to ask you not to do it on company time.   Also, keep in mind that while you are within your right to talk about salaries, you should be careful who you tell.  Telling someone who has worked at your place of employment longer, that you make a lot more than them can have a potential impact on how they see you in a work environment. However, this can also give them a reference and bargaining chip during a yearly review.
LPT: When someone says no to a piece of cake, don't try to convince them saying "it's just one piece". It's not just one piece. It's a mentally lost battle that will affect the coming battles, possibly resulting in a lost war against an unhealthy lifestyle for a person actively trying to improve.*****
LPT: When you're taking someone's photo, count to three, then keep counting until they laugh at you.*****I'm no professional but I've been doing this for a while now and it hasn't failed to get a genuine smile rather than a forced 'photo face'.
LPT: Buy a small bottle of perfume you have never tried on before going for a vacation and use it for while you're there. At any point after your vacation, you get a sniff of it, it brings back those memories instantly.*****Because scents are among the most powerful memory triggers. 
LPT: If you're tempted to upgrade your phone but yours works just fine, try buying a new case, changing the background and download a theme that will change your icons and fonts. It will appear as a different device and may scratch that itch and buy you a couple more months.*****
LPT: if you're in a bad mood or something has annoyed you, be as kind as you can to the next 3 people you encounter. By not reacting to the bad mood, as well as helping others, you'll feel miles better.*****Edit: I've ALWAYS wanted to say this, but RIP inbox. Love you guys 
LPT: If you receive a PS4 for Christmas Day this year – for sanity's sake – don't click "update" on either the software update or any game updates. Depending on your internet speeds, you will spend Christmas Day waiting for it to download and install. Do it later... like in 2019.*****Merry Christmas ya filthy animals.  &#x200B;  EDIT: Holy smokes! This... blew... UP! Thanks for the gilds!  **Redditor azninvasion2000** has a great tip below how to **pre-download and update via USB.**  [THE REAL LPT](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/a5t7jk/lpt_if_you_receive_a_ps4_for_christmas_day_this/ebp8zuj)  &#x200B;
LPT: If you get a Telemarketer calls you by your name, just say "Sorry, Wrong Number". They are more likely to take you off their calling list since they think they have wrong information profile.*****It might be slightly unethical but so are Telemarketers.
LPT: If you have aging parents, go through their bills with them and make sure they're paying fair market price for things like cable and energy. My parents were paying over $750 a month for electricity and over $400 for cable.*****The plans they had signed up for years ago had expired and their bill just kept going up and up. I was furious by the time I caught it. I can now sign on their accounts and I gave reminders set for when their different contracts expire. I got both bills down to a little less that $200.
LPT: Store potatoes and onions well apart from each other. They release moisture and gases that can make the other get bad faster.*****
LPT: Buying a car? Buy it at the end of the month. Salespeople have quotas to meet each month and will be more likely to cut you a deal.*****
LPT: If you ever find yourself stranded in the middle of nowhere, stay with your vehicle. You are much more likely to be found by searchers and will have shelter if needed.*****As a local search for a missing 74 year old hunter enters the fifth day, I'm reminded of what a Search and Rescue worker once told me, "Stay with your car, because we always find the car".  This has proven true in the case of this hunter.  His truck was found stuck in a ditch one day after he was reported missing, but unfortunately he has yet to be found.
LPT: If you're poor, homeless, just hungry, or know someone who is, go to a Sikh temple for "langar." a free meal is served to all the visitors, without distinction of religion, caste, gender, economic status or ethnicity.*****You don't need to be poor or homeless, but this seems like it will benefit those who are the most.    I wasn't sure whether this fit food & drink or money & finance, but since I'm focusing more on money I guess it's the latter. 
Lpt: don't buy TV's or computers on black friday. Most TV doorbusters are made special and lack some features as the "real TV" including fewer HDMI ports and refresh rates. Computers are also usually spec'ed down and will be obsolete within a year. Best time for computers is back to school sales.*****
LPT : if someone you know just experienced something tragic like a really bad breakup or losing someone close. Be sure to be there for them at the 3week mark, this is typicaly where everyone else gets back to their normal life, and then suddenly feel really lonely*****Edit: it seems like a lot of people are misunderstanding me, im not saying wait 3 weeks, im not saying it will be over anytime soon. And im not telling you to become their crutch (which may drag you down if you're not in the best place yourself)  Im letting you know, that after three weeks a lot of people with the best intentions slowly get back to their own lives, which may leave the hurt person lonely and in a bad place. Just be aware, dont pummel them with questions, but make sure to ask once in a while, let then know you are there if they need you. Just be attentive and help where you can, be a friend. They'll need you more than ever.
LPT: When someone is excited about something that isn't a good idea, don't burst their bubble right away. They won't be open to hearing the negative. Wait til they're in a more logical state and then ask the questions that will make them realize why it's not a good idea.***** Edit: I'm talking about the INITIAL excitement, people.  When they're telling you the idea is the peak so just let that die down a bit first before pointing out the possible obstacles.  And whether the idea is good or bad doesn't matter......it's for the people who THINK the person's idea is bad and want to poke holes in it. 
LPT: Take pictures of your hair after a good haircut. If you ever need to see a new barber, a picture's worth a thousand words.*****
LPT: If you are always worrying if you did something after leaving home, like locking the door or turning off the stove, get in the habit of speaking out the actions as you do it. Saying "I'm turning the stove off." while you do it creates a more concrete memory and will put your mind at ease.*****
LPT: If you are examining nursing homes to place a loved one, look at the fingernails of the residents living there at the moment. Long fingernails (especially on men) would likely indicate that the home is either understaffed or does not care enough to do such a small task.*****
LPT: Instead of using the phrase "I assumed..." use the phrase "My understanding was..."*****The phrase "I assumed..." has a very negative connotation, and people will view it as you jumping to conclusions without sufficient evidence.     On the other hand, if you use the phrase "My understanding was...", it has a way more positive connotation. Plus people will just view it as you made a slight mistake in understanding, and will be far kinder to you.    This is best applied in a workplace/professional environment. If you tell your boss that you "assumed" something typically results in a reprimand; saying "My understanding was..." will instead just be viewed as a miscommunication.
LPT: If you're cancelling your internet/cable and wish to avoid the elongated attempts to keep you, just tell them you're changing jobs and that your new employer will be paying for all services. They should skip right along to the cancellation!*****Verizon, Comcast, etc all require their representatives to make multiple attempts to save the account. Having done my research and knowing that Verizon is unable to offer the internet speeds I prefer in the area I'm moving to, I was able to get my service cancelled quickly and easily. 10 minute phone call, with \~5 minutes of it spent navigating the automated system.     I'm not on contract, so no cancellation fee avoidance - this is purely a way to cut the call down from 30min to 10min. 
LPT: Use olive oil instead of extra-virgin olive oil when cooking with heat. It has a higher smoke point and is cheaper. Use your nice oil for finishing dishes, not preparing them.*****
LPT: Use an infrared thermometer to check for drafts around windows, doors, electrical outlets, it doubles as a quick cooking thermometer. They cost under $20.*****EDIT 2: At the top now, since people don't like reading all the pretty words I wrote:   EDIT: Yes, you should check meat for an internal temperature prior to eating, should that be it's own LPT?  Got one last year, was surprised at how cheap and effective it is.  Our house is relatively new yet the downstairs gets frigid, my wife mentioned that the windows felt drafty yet they were solidly shut. We used this and found very slight cracks in the chaulking that were letting cold air in. After using it to find all the weak spots and rechaulking along with fixing some door insulation and closing a flue the house is much more comfortable.  Bonus: you can aim it at pans/foods and tell temps within a few degrees (surface only of course).  Double bonus: Aim it at your SO and say you found something hot.  You can get them on Amazon shipped right to you and the batteries last forever, enjoy!  EDIT 3: It's clear from this thread why warning labels and EULAs exist.  No this isn't a 100% perfect item, it's cheap and does a few things and is neat. Don't eat raw/undercooked meat. People are weird, including myself.      Another poster kindly sent this to explain the (approximate) zone of temperature reading:  I’m way too late to get seen in your thread but I wanted to add the ir scanner makes a cone of scan. Some are 12:1, 16:1 or even 30:1 so the distance from the scanned surface will reveal the average temp of a circle 1/12 diameter the distance to the object. 12 ft away makes a 1 ft circle, 24’ = 2’ circle etc.
LPT: if an indoor cat gets outside and lost, put their litter box outside. They can smell it from up to a mile away and find their way home.*****
LPT: When buying a car at a dealership and they leave you alone to talk about it, check their desk phone speaker light. If it is on, they are most definitely listening to your conversation from the back office.*****   It happened to us when I bought my first used car at a VW dealership. We were discussing the sale price and he left us to "talk about it" while he went to "run some numbers" by the finance manager. I had given an offer of $1000 below their asking price as that is what I could afford. My mother said she could chip in $500 more if that would help me out.   He came back and said his "boss" could meet in the middle, $500 off sale price.  We were quite happy about it all and it was done.  Later on I got an office job with the exact same phones the dealership had. Found out the green light button was lit when the phone was active, and the microphone on.
LPT: Don't think of accountants and lawyers as people you only need for taxes and trials. No: they're pretty much the only people who know the ACTUAL rules for how the world works. Think of them instead as people you can talk to before any big life decision.*****
LPT: If you’re listening to someone in the middle of a conversation and it gets interrupted, one of the best things you can do is to ask them to finish what they were saying.*****It shows that you truly care about what they have to say and that means so much more than you’d think. This will do wonders for making friends as well as improving relationships in general.  Everyone wants to be heard, but nobody wants to listen.
LPT: If you're buying a home printer for occasional use, get a laser printer; they're more expensive up front but way more economical in the long run.*****Edit: WOW! Front page! I'm on cloud 9 right now.   To answer the most common question, inkjet ink is exceptionally expensive and priced that way because the company's got you where they want you by selling you a cheap printer. Laser printers use toner which is more expensive to replace, but lasts longer. Inkjet ink dries out when it's not used and is wasted. Kinda like running the engine on a car when it's not being driven.   As for photos, many people have pointed this out and it's a valid concern. Many laser printers do an excellent job on photos and they're getting better, but ink is still king. You still have options.   I mostly despise how the companies are gouging consumers. 
LPT: If a service dog without a person approaches you, it means the person is down and in need of help.*****Well a post that I cropped from r/ULPT is my highest upvoted thing so cool...
LPT: If you’re ever in the heat of an argument, always act like you’re being recorded. This helps you from saying things you don’t mean and could regret later.*****This has always helped me remain calmer in disagreements!
LPT: As soon as you wake up, do a simple or small chore like making your bed or doing your dishes. Completing a simple task right when you wake up puts you in a more productive mood.*****
LPT: Job security is a two-edged sword; if you are irreplaceable, you are also unpromotable*****Always have a plan for your success: this means doing work that you are  good at, and having someone available to do your job so you can be  promoted to your next job.
LPT: If you realize your fridge is getting empty, take 30 minutes to clean the inside before you go grocery shopping again*****
LPT: For those living in cold areas, take a coat and have blankets in your car on each trip. You never know when your car may break down and it can quickly become life threatening.*****
LPT: If you have a big problem at work and you need to break the bad news to your boss, try to come up with a couple of ideas for how to fix the issue before you talk to them. It will come off better and help everyone focus on the next steps. Problems happen, always try to be part of the solution.*****
LPT: If you are buying anything for your wedding, do not tell the vendors it’s for a wedding. Just say a party. Most companies charge 3-4x for weddings even if it’s the same stuff.*****This includes cakes. You can just say it’s for a party before the wedding. Same cake. Hundreds of dollars cheaper.  Edit: I guess I need to clarify a bit. If a vendor is attending the wedding, don’t try to bamboozle them. This is for stuff that you pick up (Tents, chairs, cake, lights, etc.)  Any vendors coming to the wedding should be prepared that it’s a wedding (band, photographer, caterer etc).
LPT: If you pay for Netflix, reset your password every year or two. That way anyone who's been using it will reach out to you when they can't log in, allowing you to keep tabs on your freeloaders and decide whether or not to continue letting them use it for free.*****
LPT: Bring a 24-hour survival kit on even the shortest hike*******TL;DR: Short hikes are dangerous because people go into them without gear and preparation to fall back on if things go bad. Make a 24-hour survival kit out of an old water bottle and always throw it into your backpack on even the shortest day-hikes.**  Short hikes are the most dangerous, for one simple reason: people underestimate them and thus go into them without gear and preparation to rely on if things go bad.  The recent (happy) story of a woman who was rescued after 17 days lost in the Hawaii jungle is illustrative of countless similar stories of even experienced hikers going on short, "fun" day hikes, getting turned around/injured, and then getting thoroughly lost - without the water, food, gear, maps, and preparation they'd have on a longer trail.  She survived, but she easily could have died. *On a 3-mile trail that she'd hiked before.*  I myself am a veteran hiker and backpacker. The only time I've ever gotten lost was on a ridiculously short and easy day hike. I got turned around, night fell, etc. etc. It really can happen to just about anyone. I got myself out, but it wasn't a sure thing.  And now, with the popularity of parks exploding, I see more and more people going onto trails absolutely unprepared for anything other than balmy, kind, daylight conditions. Thin cotton clothes, maybe one water bottle, flimsy urban footwear, no map/compass/understanding of the topography. If anything happens, these people are absolutely hooped.  So: never go unprepared. Get a wide-mouth Nalgene bottle and stuff it with some/all of the following (in generally descending order of importance). Just toss it into your day pack alongside your water and you'll at least have some basic essentials if things go bad.  The things I have in mine include:  \- Survival heating blanket  \- Plastic sheet to use as shelter  \- Whistle  \- Flashlight/headlamp, with extra batteries  \- Lighters/matches (don't melt the sheet/blanket, though!)  \- Critical meds and bandages  \- Zip ties (these things have countless uses)  \- Flagging tape (bright color - use it to mark your course so you can backtrack if unsure, and/or to alert rescuers)  \- Compass (if you're able to use it)  \- Paracord  \- Knife  \- Duct tape (same as zip ties - countless uses; you can just wrap a bunch around the water bottle and pull off as necessary)  \- Hand warmers if you're in temperate/colder areas, even in the summer (I always put this right at the top of my kit, so it's the first thing I can grab - when you're really cold, your hands can stop working, so you need to get them working to do anything else to save yourself - I've experienced this first-hand).  \- Iodine tabs for water  \- Beef jerky  \- Energy gel  **Edit:** Because it may be of interest: I just weighed it at 754 g - and that's with some additional stuff that I don't mention in the list. For reference, a liter of water (without a bottle) is 1 kg.  **Edit 2:** I wrote this for people who regularly go on short hikes without *any* first aid/survival stuff. The kit I describe is absolutely bare-bones and does not replace knowledge, preparation, and/or better gear.   The kit I mention shouldn't give you any additional confidence and certainly shouldn't encourage additional risk-taking - it's a last-resort fallback that is better than nothing at all.  For people wanting to see the kit I made, or skeptical it can be done - just google Nalgene survival kit. Lots of people put a lot more time and thought into this than I have, and have kits that are a lot prettier than mine.   Definitely tailor your kit to your area, too.  Finally: as always, the most important things to have are proper clothing, footwear, water, knowledge of the area, knowledge of what risks your area poses (e.g., hypothermia at night, heat stroke, etc), ability to read the weather, and the knowledge and skills to help yourself and others if things go bad. *This kit will not make up for deficits in those areas.*
LPT: If you decide to volunteer to give up your seat on an overbooked flight, don't just take the offer. Tell the gate agent "toss in another $200 (or more/less depending on your best judgment), and I'll go for it." They'll almost always say OK, because a willing volunteer is worth it.*****Also, if they offer to give you a meal voucher, ask for a day pass to their first class club.  There will be food there anyway, and they'll have nice seating and other amenities.
LPT: When it’s hot out (like now, in the northern hemisphere), consider leaving a frozen sports drink or bottle of water out for your mail carrier. Mail trucks do not have AC and it will be GREATLY appreciated*****Just make sure you tell your carrier it’s for them, or leave a note, otherwise they generally won’t take it. Heat indexes are outta control right now and I promise you, your mail carrier is sweaty and miserable.  Edited to add: The FedEx, UPS, and garbage pickup folks like cold drinks too!
LPT: If you can smell your own perfume/cologne througout the day, you have used it too much. It will annoy people.*****
LPT: When you buy a house change out the water hoses for the washing machine because you never know when they were replaced last and are one of the most common causes of catastrophic water damage in homes.*****
LPT If somebody comes to your door selling a home security system and asks if you have one, always say yes.*****If they ask which company, tell them it's none of their business.    Many people looking for homes to rob will come to your door asking about security systems. It gives them a chance to case the home and look for weaknesses like if you don't have a dog or if the house is homed by women or the elderly.    Edit: Great advice from /u/OA27   >Furthermore, document the encounter to the best of your ability. This is not the time you want to shoo someone away immiediately. Be comfortable being uncomfortable and without escalating the situation, ask as many questions as you can. Who are you with (even if they lie, they likely have told that lie before), contact numbers, etc. Did they come in a vehicle? Take the plates down, make, model, any damage to the vehicle. Which direction did they go in, did they talk to any neighbors.  
LPT: When you come back from a holiday, dont go straight back to work. Plan a few extra days off for when you can return, unpack, relax and still be in holiday mode. This way, going back to work won't be as daunting.*****Edit: Wow..people you need the calm the farm down. For the few smarties out there..that caught on that I am not American..here is a slow clap for you. Now for the rest of you, let me reprase what I mean. What you Americans call vacation days..is what the rest of the world call holidays. That is what I mean. You dont need to travel all across the Antartic to enjoy this LPT. I merely mean, if you were to take a 3 or 4 day vacation, to even say go visit your grandma that lives in another time zone. Come home with another day or two off to spare..or close to a weekend (if your sadistic employers give you a weekend off) That way, you get to recoup, rewind, look at pictures, unpack..do whatever the heck your heart desires. Before you go back to the hell hole you call life.
LPT: If you rent a tool from Home Depot after 6pm (mine closes at 9pm) you can rent it for the 4 hour price versus the 24hr price as long as you get it back to them by 9am the next day.*****
LPT: when walking your dogs, make them sit and wait before crossing streets. This will make them hesitate about running into roads if they ever get loose.*****This was taught to us long ago and we've implemented with all of our dogs since. Recently one got out of the side fence and we saw her run to the street, stop, look around, then run back. It's not foolproof but it is good instilled behavior in case of an unfortunate incident. 
LPT:If you work in a place that loses pens constantly, you can order a box of thousands on Ebay for pennies each if you look for misprinted advertising pens.*****
[LPT] If you suffer from anxiety or an uncomfortable feeling of butterflies in your stomach, simply wash your face with cool water. An effect called the "diving reflex" will instantly lower your heart-rate substantially, helping you calm down.*****Edit: For the best effects, you should fully submerge your face in ice cold water for about 40 seconds - 1 minute (obviously don't drown yourself or push yourself too much, do whatever time is comfortable for you), although in my experience even splashing your face with ice cold water has managed to disrupt feelings of anxiety for me.
LPT: If you're put on hold and don't hear music there's a good chance you're just muted and they can still hear you*****Might not want to say mean things about someone trying to find you an answer or sing in your car...we can hear you 
LPT: If you are flying with someone make sure to divide your clothes*****50 percent of your clothes in your parthner's luggage and the other half in yours, if one bag gets lost you'll still have somethnig to dress when you arrive to the destination.  excuse me for poor english, not native speaker.
LPT: Open chip bags upside down. They've been sitting upright most of their lives which makes the seasoning settle to the bottom of the bag.*****Edit: Hey, thanks for the silver and gold whoever did that! I'm definitely pleasantly surprised this blew up like it did. Never knew that chip bag opening could be such a hot topic.  Aside from the seasoning (yeah, agreed that this only really happens with some chip types), the bigger part of this for me is that the little crunched up pieces fall into the big chips, so you get big chips that are topped with tiny more seasoned chips throughout the bag.  Also agree from a health standpoint, the better LPT is probably to eat fewer chips :-P But nothing wrong with treating yourself every now and then.  Thanks again folks! Fun way to end the weekend :)
LPT: If your clothes don't smell fresh even after washing, it could be your machine. The easiest way to get rid of mold in your machine is to use 1-2 dishwasher tabs or some detergent and do a cycle without clothes.*****
LPT: When making an argument, a single strong point is better than one strong point and multiple weak points. Weak points become targets and weaken your entire position.*****
LPT: When meeting new people, don't make a joke with their name, however funny or harmless you may think it is. They're probably sick of it. At best you come off as boring, at worst you're a dick.*****
LPT: When stressing over something, use the 10-10-10 rule. Will it matter in 10 days? 10 months? 10 years? After getting some perspective, you’ll notice how very few things end up worth stressing over.*****
LPT: if you have a friend who has their own business. Don't expect mates rates or discounts. Instead always be prepared to pay the full amount, a pay full price if they offer a discount. It is their livelyhood and they may feel pressured to do you a deal that will actually leave them out of pocket.*****
LPT: Want cleaner dishes? Clean the filter in your dishwasher machine. Yes! Dishwashers have filters underneath the blade that should be removed and cleaned monthly for better washing results and it’s not hard to do. Research the brand and model of machine you have for specific information.*****
LPT: If you have to cancel plans with someone, immediately ask them when they are free again in the future and make replacement plans. It makes people feel like you do really care about seeing them and you appear less flaky.*****
LPT: microwaving leftovers or a frozen meal? Turn the power DOWN and the timer UP. 10mins at half power does a better job than 3 minutes on full throttle. Food comes out looking like food!!!*****Seriously, microwaves only do a shit job if you're impatient. Dial the power back, cook it for longer, and go choose your show on Netflix or whatevs while it cooks - you know you're just gonna let it go cold while you choose a show anyway, so get on top of your shit, flip it and reverse it, choose the show first and enjoy your hot leftovers rather than choking down a cold soggy mess.  For example: a lean cuisine green curry & rice says on the box "COOK ON HIGH FOR 3 MINUTES LET STAND AND SERVE" - but it only says that because they know you're an impatient little shit and won't buy the box that says "COOK ON 1/4 POWER FOR 12 MINUTES" because if you're not going to cook your own calorie controlled curry, you're also not going to stand around waiting *TWELVE WHOLE MINUTES* for this one when the *other* brand says it's done in three.   EDIT BECAUSE YOU PEOPLE NEVER STOP POSTING THE SAME 'SUCH TIME YUCK MICROWAVE 20 MINS IN OVEN INSTEAD AM SMART' COMMENT A MILLION TIMES OVER:  I'm a chef. You all have high hopes for how quickly your oven pre heats, and how easily you can remove a frozen meal from plastic Tupperware to change into an oven safe dish. You all also seem to be the type of person who would blast their shit in the microwave anyway, because s frozen curry being cooked through in the oven in 20 mins from turning the oven on would mean using a blast furnace. Also, did the title say "if you're choosing how to reheat something...?" No. It doesn't. Because I'm SPECIFICALLY addressing **Microwave** usage, so outta here with your faux superiority, go make your own thread about ovens and toaster ovens and airfryers. Not everyone has those things - dorm students may have a cooktop and convection microwave. I certainly don't have space for a toaster oven to sit around on my bench like a jerk all day (that's what the microwave is for).   Also for those asking about fries: skip the microwave and go straight to the sandwich press. You're welcome. 
LPT: You can access most MIT courses for free online*****[https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm)  They have high quality courses on everything from business to computer science, complete with notes and video lectures, FOR FREE.
LPT: "Do you know why I pulled you over?" Translates from cop speak as "Are you stupid enough to incriminate yourself for my benefit?"*****Never answer this even if it is obvious. At best, you have just admitted guilt. A worse possibility is that you confess something else:  You:  "Because I didn't come to a complete stop / speeding / seatbelt?"  Cop:  "No, your tail light is out. But I'll write that down too."  Reddit, what is the best way to answer a question like this that may diffuse the situation and perhaps send you on your way without a ticket?   Edit:  Did not expect this post to generate so much emotion. For the record, I agree with those who encourage courtesy and politeness in dealing with any situation.   Edit 2:  In no way am I suggesting lying or dishonesty of any sort in encounters with law enforcement.  I think those who are recommending a polite, humorous response to this question have the right idea. 
LPT: Before Proposing To A Girl, Go Find An Excuse For Her To Get Her Nails Done Beforehand*****When she wants to send photos of the ring to friends and family or post it to social media, she'll be thankful that her nails look the best possible that they can before sharing such an up-close photo of her hand.
LPT: One of the first things you should do when moving into a new home is to change the locks. You never know who might have a key to the house in their possession.*****
LPT: Use a spent, empty Visa giftcard to sign up for all those free 1st month trials. You never have to worry about being overdrafting or your personal info being compromised.*****Edit: I'd like to shout out my Mom! Happy birthday Mom! Couldn't have done this without you. Can't begin to imagine all the things, let alone a small fraction of the blessings your being provides our family. You are appreciated. Say hi!   Edit 2: Shout out to the homies who blessed me with Platinum and Silver, it was really cool feeling a part of a community here, shoot me a message back maybe we can *kick it*.
LPT: Go buy a decent shower head (like $30-50 decent). You use it every day (at least once), and the newer heads have better pressure, more options, and typically use less water. Better experience for you, while saving money and our planet.*****
LPT: Children's Hospitals do not need donations of stuffed animals. Try hard plastic toys featuring popular characters, craft supplies, board games, and coloring books.*****Source: I'm on playroom staff at the local children's hospital.   Stuffed animals are an infection risk and often not allowed if they are not brand new. Even if they are brand new, they are not allowed in our playroom. Other staff seems to find some use for them, but ultimately there are many higher need toys and games. Teen items like adult coloring books, video games, and craft supplies are always appreciated. 
LPT: if you go clubbing or to concerts a lot buy yourself acoustic earplugs. They don’t muffle the sound, just get rid of the harmful frequencies. Tinnitus is something very easy to get and very hard/impossible to get rid of.*****Edit: As professional audiologists in here have pointed out, the earplugs of this type don't remove any harmful frequencies, but reduce the overall noise without affecting the quality of the sound too much.

LPT: When it is unclear whether you should use"who" or "whom" in a question, pay attention to the potential answer. If "he" sounds right in the answer then "who" is usually correct. If "him" sounds right in the answer then "whom" is usually correct.*****Examples:  "Whom is our leader?"  -->  "Him is our leader"  :/ "Who is our leader?"  -->  "He is our leader"   :) "Who should we follow?"  -->  "We should follow he"  :/ "Whom should we follow?"  -->  "We should follow him"  :)  Edit: also works with who/they and whom/them. "Who is next? They are next." "Whom do we admire? Hmm, definitely not them"

LPT: Find a pair of socks you REALLY like and only buy the same pair so you always get a matching pair of socks from the basket after washing them.*****
LPT: If your flight gets cancelled while you are at the airport, don't approach the ticket agent, but call the 1800 number to re-book your flight.*****Everyone on the flight will be looking to get on the next best option and a lot of them will be annoyed or upset, adding stress to you, those around them and the agents. Your best move is to sit down and call the 1800 number of your airline where a person will be able to re-book you before the red-faced screamers ahead of you in line.  As an add-on, always be polite to your ticket agent, they might have the power to make your travel a lot more pleasant, and even if they don't they do not have control over your flight getting cancelled, so taking your frustration out on them is not solving anything.
LPT: When trying to solve a computer error code by doing a google search, include the word "solved" in your search.*****I'm sure this has come been raised before, but I always forget until afterwards.
LPT: Be mindful of poorer friends when suggesting splitting the bill equally in a restaurant. Some people will choose cheaper options because they're on a budget*****I don't earn a lot of money and get major anxiety if anyone in my friendship group suggests going to a restaurant. Last week, I drank tap water and ordered cheap food (I'm veggie so my meals are usually cheaper anyway, but I did fancy a few beers) because I knew I only had a certain amount of money in my bank, while my friends ordered whatever they wanted, including multiple alcoholic drinks, spending nearly double what I was spending. When the bill came, nobody noticed my discomfort (I tried dropping hints!) and I ended up having to split the bill equally. To them it was probably a few quid, no biggie, ("it all balances out eventually"), but it absolutely ruined my evening as my card was declined in front of everyone  EDIT: I should have said, my close friends know that I'm skint (I talk about it openly), just maybe didn't realise how dire the situation was at that moment. But when it's a large group with lots of friends and their partners who you don't know very well it can be humiliating to draw attention to it in front of a table of people. I know *technically* it solves the problem to announce to everyone that you'll only be paying for what you personally consumed and no more, but it's nicer for someone to notice: "XX didn't have drinks or a dessert, shall we all just pay for what we had?"
LPT: During this shopping season don't forget that Reddit is hands down the best review website on the internet. Type the product your thinking about buying directly into the Reddit search bar to find real reviews and plenty of quality conversation around whatever you're thinking about buying.*****
LPT: If you want to learn another language, watch children’s shows in that language to pick up on it quicker.*****
LPT: If you have to leave your puppy/kitten/ baby animal alone during the day, get them a soft stuffed animal about twice their size. It will help sooth separation anxiety and provide comfort.*****
LPT: if you are donating to a person or family that has fallen on hard times, consider household items instead of food. Lots of people bring meals, but TP, dish soap, paper towels, etc run out quickly and are usually just as appreciated as food.*****
LPT: Trying to learn a new language? Watch a movie you know by heart that's dubbed and/or subtitled in that language. It will aid in word association and comprehension and speed up the process of become proficient.*****
LPT: when training someone new, do not assume they know things. Go over everything unless they tell you specifically that they already know it.*****
LPT: One of the biggest reasons people have messy living spaces is that they don't have enough dedicated places for their stuff. Try to give everything a defined space to be in/on/under and you will be much less likely to just drop it wherever.*****
LPT: It is important to note that you get the courage after you do the thing that you are so anxious and terrified of doing, not before.*****
LPT: If you are composing an important message, do not enter the recipient until you have finished composing it so that you do not accidentally send an incomplete message.*****
LPT — Quickly find out whether a power outage is affecting your neighbors too by whipping out your phone and scanning for Wi-Fi networks. If there's a lot less networks than normal, your neighbors' power is probably out too.*****Generally, no power = no router = no Wi-Fi = no fun.
LPT: If you like a lot of Parmesan cheese on your pasta, put it on the pasta and mix it around before you cover it in the sauce. Every noodle will be coated in cheese and covered in sauce. It will change your life.*****
LPT: Disable the center channel audio line on a 5.1 surround sound system to mute the Olympic commentary*****I know this has been posted before, but I thought it deserved a bump for the Olympics.    Commentary can be nice, but when the sportscasters feel obligated to fill dead air, it can be cringe inducing to listen to them vamp.  Edit: A word.
LPT: If someone is getting worked up and overexcited and frustrated about a topic, they're probably just venting and not asking for advice. Be there to listen, not to lecture.*****
LPT: If you spot a cockroach larger than 1 inch inside of your house, it's an outside cockroach that found its way in. If you find a cockroach under 1 inch long, it's a cockroach that lives in your home and likely has plenty of buddies.*****Edit: This applies mostly to North American homes, our house-dwelling cockroaches aren’t very large
LPT: When buying a used car, start it and rev the engine while you have a friend watch the exhaust. If the exhaust has a blue tint to it, it means the engine is burning oil and you should immediately walk away.*****EDIT: Thanks to everyone for the extra tips, but just to clear things up I completely agree you should take it to a mechanic once you've made the purchase and have them take a look. This is just for when you're initially seeing the car. Another thing is I know it's fairly common for cars to burn oil, however if it's burning enough that it's making it through the catalytic converter then you most likely have a head gasket that's shot. Not worth the risk in my mind.  Source: I am a mechanic
LPT: Don't judge your "market value" as a romantic partner during your teenage years/ early twenties. A lot of decisions during that time are hormone-driven.*****Adolescence lasts much longer than most people think, until around 25. Before that, the human brain is not yet fully mature, meaning that psychological and behavioural patterns still undergo changes. Thus, our "true personality" only manifests itself during the late twenties.  Before that happens, people are often "in lust" rather than in love, but without realizing it. Our bodies are wired to produce as much offspring as possible as soon as possible, because early humans used to die young. This can lead to our relationship decisions in high school and sometimes college being based on biological urges rather than compatibility of personalities.  So don't worry if you can't find a partner in high school or even college - the good times are still ahead of you!  EDIT: to clarify, I'm not saying not to date until you're older, just to not let yourself be discouraged by setbacks in your love life.
LPT: If you are nervous walking into a new place with a group of people, make sure you are the first to the building. You can hold the door for everyone else making yourself look kind, yet you will be the last one in and can follow everyone elses lead.*****
LPT: Instead of excessively worrying over a decision, decide what you're going to do, then do things to *make* it the right decision afterward.*****The best class I took in my Masters program was a decision science course. The prof had a lot of great LPT-type advice, but one thing he said in particular has stuck with me. He said most people will excessively worry and over-analyze a decision, but then do very little about it after the decision is made. We spend 95% of our energy pre-decision, then 5% after. However, he said a lot of the science shows that very often there isn't a "right" decision, but there are things we can do after that will make it right. For example, don't feel like there's a right/wrong decision to make when considering a job offer out of state. If you do decide to take it, once you're there do things to "make it" the right decision, like go out and make friends, work hard but keep a good work/life balance, etc. Change that 95/5 split to more like 50/50.  EDIT: Wow, my first reddit gold! Seriously, thanks!
LPT: Most juices/drinks that advertise 50% less sugar are simply watered down. You can save money by watering down the normal product.*****
LPT: When comparing ice cream for quality, but the ingredient list looks the similar, compare the weight of a serving on the nutrition label. Denser is better. The gums and fillers used in lower quality ice cream are lighter than cream and eggs.*****If one says a serving is 1/4 cup (65g) and the other says a serving is 1/4 cup (73g), get the 73g one. They may both have some fillers, but the denser one will have less.
LPT: how I killed my procrastination problems*****I had a huge procrastination problem. Couldn’t do anything in my life: didn’t workout, didn’t study, couldn’t do a thing as simple as cleaning my room. But one night I thought to myself: what if I did productive stuff not for me, but for tomorrow me? Now every time I want to sit on my phone, I think to myself: would future me be happy that I did that? If not, what could I do that future me would be happy about? Been doing this for a month now, I can’t believe how much my life has changed.
LPT: When you are trying to resolve an issue where someone else made an error, put the focus on the error and not the person. Example of this: Instead of saying, “You didn’t send the attachment,” I say, “The attachment didn’t come through, please try sending it again.”*****Edit: check comments for additional / better tips
LPT: Never assume that someone won't be able to go to an event, it's always better to invite them anyway, that way they know they haven't purposefully been left out. It'll avoid a lot of negativity.*****
LPT: If you want to giveaway some stuff for free don't list them under "Free", instead put some good price on them. When a descent person shows up, offer the products for free. You'll get lots of thanks. You'll also get rid of "choosing beggars" and those who swap free stuff for money.*****
LPT go for that run, no one is looking at you, dont overthink it, do it*****
LPT: Thinking of moving? Google "military BAH" for an idea on how much it costs to live somewhere*****One of the things the military does very well is calculate the cost of living in areas of the US. This is heavily researched so the government doesn't over or underpay servicemembers. If you're thinking of moving to a new area and are curious how much it costs for rent & utilities, just google military Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) and you'll see how much the military pays servicemembers to live there!  Edit: Lots of people are asking about this for non-U.S. territories.. There is! Check out the [Overseas Housing Allowance calculator](http://https://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/site/ohaCalc.cfm) for more information!
LPT: If you have to give or take names, addresses, serial codes, etc. on your job, take time to learn the NATO phonic alphabet. It will make the communication go much smoother. Plus you'll gain the appreciation if the other person is a pilot.*****Alfa, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot, Golf, Hotel, India, Juliett, Kilo, Lima, Mike, November, Oscar, Papa, Quebec, Romeo, Sierra, Tango, Uniform, Victor, Whiskey, X-ray, Yankee, Zulu.
LPT: when on phone with a call center and put on”Hold” , if u do NOT hear music — you are on “mute” and the CSR can hear you . Don’t say anything negative, it will come back to haunt you.*****
LPT: If an ad on YouTube is unskippable and long, you can tap the (i) in bottom left hand corner, then "stop seeing this ad", then choose irrelevant, repetitive, or inappropriate (all work). It will end immediately and earlier than if you had watched the entire ad.*****Edit: Guys, everyone knows that adblock exists. This is mainly useful for watching YouTube on mobile. 
LPT At the beginning of EVERY semester, make a dedicated folder for your class where you download and save all documents ESPECIALLY the SYLLABUS. Teachers try to get sneaky sometimes!*****Taught this to my sister last year.  She just came to me and told me about how her AP English teacher tried to pull a fast one on the entire class.  &#x200B;  I've had it happen to me before as well in my bachelors.  &#x200B;  Teacher changes the syllabus to either add new rules or claim there was leniancy options that students didn't take advantage of. Most of the time it's harmless but sometimes it's catastrophic to people's grades.  &#x200B;  In my case, teacher tried to act like there was a requirement people weren't meeting for their reports. Which was not in the original syllabus upload.  &#x200B;  In my sister's case, the english teacher was giving nobody more than an 80% on their weekly essays. So when a bunch of students complained and brought their parents, he modified the syllabus to act like he always gave them the option to come in after school and re-write the essays but they never took advantage of it. One of my sister's friends was crying because her mom, a teacher at that school, was mad at her for not going in for the make-up after school.  When confronted about this not being in the original syllabus, he acted like it was always there. My sister of course had the original copy downloaded and handled it like a boss! Now people get to make up their missed points and backdate it.  &#x200B;  Sorry to all good teachers out there but not all teachers are as ethical as we'd like to think.  &#x200B;  Edit:  AP English is in high school, it's an advanced placement class equivalent to a college credit. Difficult but most students in there are hard working.  &#x200B;  Final Edit:  The goal of doing this is not to catch a teacher in their lie, the reasons to make a folder dedicated for a class from day 1 and keeping copies of everything locally are too many to list, they include taking ownership, having records, making it easy for yourself, learning to be organized, having external organization, overcoming lack of organization in an LMS, helping you study offline, reducing steps needed to access something, annotating PDFs, and many more. The story here is teachers getting sneaky but I have dozens more stories to show why you should do it in general for your own good.
LPT: If you use your laptop for work, create a separate user for presentations. This will prevent embarrassing pop-ups or web history.*****I've seen people open their browser and it shows their porn history in the first tab and another guy had his text messages display on his screen. A buddy was texting asking if he wanted "to get fucked up" after the meeting.  This can be avoided by creating a user that you only use for presentations and only grant access to office related programs.
LPT: When on conference calls, get in the habit of muting yourself all of the time unless you are talking.*****Treat the call as 'push to talk'. It reduces background noise and means you can make plenty of noise eating, sneezing or practising guitar.
LPT: If you wake up in the middle of the night, don’t check the time. This will allow you to fall back asleep without worrying about how many hours you have left.*****
LPT: When you're hitting yourself over something you did in the past, consider this: what are the odds that anyone remembers in that exact moment? They might recall you occasionally, but most people are too engrossed in their own lives to care. Keep living your life and make the future even better.*****
LPT: If you want to lose weight, keep in mind that you cannot outrun a bad diet. It takes ~3500 calories to burn a pound of fat, while running a marathon (26.2 miles) only burns about 2600 calories.*****
LPT: As a manager, don't let your pride cloud your judgement when someone has a better idea than you on a decision. It's an improvement on a course of action, not your character.*****&#x200B;
LPT: If you want to learn a new language, figure out the 100 most frequently used words and start with them. Those words make up about 50% of everyday speech already (!) and should be a very solid basis.*****
LPT: In Emergency or Disaster Situations, You Can Relay Important Information to Others Via Your Outgoing Voicemail Greeting.*****In an effort to conserve phone power or if it looks like you will have no way to re-charge in an emergency, leave your last location, general safety status, or other important information on your outgoing voicemail message.   
LPT: when cleaning out your closet, think “if I saw this at the store right now, would I buy this again?” If the answer is no, it might be time to get rid of that item.*****I use this when cleaning out my closet/room of old clothes/items. If I look at a top I usually think to myself, if I saw this for the first time would I buy this in the same size and color? If yes, then I keep it, if not, I donate it.  Edit: Not suggesting you should/would buy the same thing twice. It’s meant to be a reflective question of whether or not you still like it enough to keep, so if you had never gotten it and saw it for the first time at a store, would you still like it enough to spend money (in theory) on it today. 
LPT: When buying bedsheets, look for striped ones. It will make it much easier to find the long and short sides.*****
LPT: Don’t put yourself down in order to compliment someone, ESPECIALLY children*****I work in a school and often hear adults say things like “wow, you’re such a good artist! I can’t draw anywhere near that well” or “you’re so good at math, I could never do my times tables that fast.” Using phrasing like that teaches kids (or anyone) that 1) all talent is competitive- how good you are at something is defined by how much better you are than others and 2) that their success makes others feel bad about themselves, and by extension they should feel bad about others’ success.  Instead, model positive effort-based comments, like  “wow you’re so good at art! I hope I can be that good someday if I keep practicing!” Or non-comparative positive statements, like “wow you’re so good at art! Its so fun to use your imagination to make something new.” You can also never go wrong by praising effort over talent, as in “you’re so good at math! You must study very hard.”  Same goes for talking to adults (although the imagination comment might be a little cheesy so you’d want to reword).
LPT If someone is acting like they don’t care about you, believe them.*****Edit: I thought that my point was obvious, my mistake.     If there is anyone in your life, at any capacity, who straight up acts as they don’t care about you, you should take their actions at face value.     For example, if you a friend who always is being a dick but you rationalize it by saying “uhh yeah- it’s just an act, deep down they are nice”, then stop. You should assume that they mean they way the act, and not seek deeper meaning.
LPT: December is a tough month for those struggling with depression. A great way to fight it is by volunteering and volunteering is very simple.*****It's a win-win situation.  In my personal experience my own problems seem to sort themselves out when I start to help other people with theirs.  Get in the holiday spirit and volunteer!  A very simple example would be a service like meals on wheels, it can be as easy as picking up food and dropping it off to someone that needs it.  If you don't have a car they also need help prepping food.  Their info is readily available online.  Animal shelters always need volunteers to walk and wash dogs amongst other things.  Be careful with this one, you will be tempted to adopt!  Perhaps you are skilled in a trade.  Find a lucky individual to offer your services to for free.  There are endless ways.  Make cookies for your work.  Shovel your neighbors driveway.  Watch your friends kids for free.  Things to expect for 1st timers:  It's work!  It won't necessarily be fun.  You will need to sacrifice to make it happen, whether that's time, money, both, or simply canceling/skipping out on something else.  You WILL feel good about it and if you are someone that is struggling with depression it can help you realize you are a good person that deserves to feel good about yourself!  Feel free to share positive volunteering stories, without advertising of course.

LPT: If someone you know suffered a great loss and you want to show support, here are some do's and don'ts*****I lost my wife a few weeks ago and received a whole lot of support messages. This may be a bit subjective, but seeing how I felt about most of these, and what I am going through since, I now know what I will and won't do when something similar happens to someone I know, so I wanted to share:  The first contact, right after you get the news, is important because it shows you care, but don't try to find the right words, or worse, don't state that there is no words that can ease their pain. This is obvious, and you are the 1000th one to say that. They know. They just need to know you're there.  Do not, in any case, state that if they need anything, they can call you. Yes, I need to talk to someone after the kids are asleep, I need the hedge trimmed, I need someone to look after the kids on Thursday, I need a second income to keep paying my bills, I need a friend with benefit to compensate for my brutal lack of physical interactions. Don't make them draw the line between what's reasonable and what's not. Don't make them chose who to call among the fifty people that were this vague in case they actually have a need they find reasonable.  If you think you can bring something specific, be specific. They need to know you are the one to call in this specific situation.  If the specific thing you have to offer is just to be available for a phone call when they need someone to talk to, then it is not enough to say it. One hundred people told me that I can call them whenever I need to talk, some of them specified "even in the middle of the night". It may be just me, but when I am trying to go on with my life and receive calls from different persons a couple of times a day, then I feel less alone. If I get nothing for a couple of days, then this situation is really depressing, and having a list of a hundred people I can interrupt in their daily lives to suck some comfort off, does not help at all. So just call them from time to time, weeks and even months after the fact. Show you think about them, don't make them call you out of despair.  &#x200B;  EDIT: before I go to bed, I just want to clarify a couple of things that induce misunderstandings that keep coming to my mailbox:  This is not a rant. I do not resent people that did the things I listed. As I stated in my first paragraph, I experienced the effect they had on me, I think I have learned things from this, I would like to share. I thought I was clear about this, but every support message I got was comforting. Some were just much more useful than others.   The "Do not, in any case" intro is clearly horribly worded. Yes. My bad. What I mean is, when you say something so vague, it doesn't have any more effect than a simple "sorry for your loss". If you are genuinely willing to help, then this does not bring the message across.  The FWB part. Ok, I was illustrating how "anything" is completely useless in this context, because you make the person draw his own line between what is reasonable and what is not. To illustrate how this line was completely subjective, I gave several examples to illustrate the fact that you had to draw a line somewhere. Starting from something completely reasonable, finishing with something I thought everybody would consider unreasonable in this context. Three of these five examples are completely made up. I was just making a point.
LPT: Bunnys are NO Easter gift.*****With easter coming around again there are many bunnies gifted away to children in too small cages and most of the time alone, and not neutered and/or spayed.   Some facts for y'all.  Bunnies are as much work as a cat, if not even more! (ok, it seems they are much more work than a cat)  They poop. A lot.  You need to clean their toilets. A Lot.  You need at least 2 Bunnies! (1 neutered male, 1 female can be Spayed*)   Bunnies need at least 2 square meters per bunny and they need to have enough space to run around so better 3 square meters per bunny.  Bunnies are not for picking up! They are prey animals and get scared if you pick it up!  They need medical attention as much as dogs/cats if not even more.  You need to take care of their nails. (or the  vet you trust)  This post was created because my sister wanted to gift 1 bunny to my nephew and i had to talk her out of it, so please don't gift bunnies they are a fuckton of work.   Edit: Here have the Bunnies. Im not a native speaker.  Meet Sir Poopalot http://imgur.com/an5KClw  And meet Big Momma(right one) and Bono Fluffelbutt(left one) http://imgur.com/yVrlRiA

LPT: If your job involves a lot of talking on the phone, take the time to learn the NATO Phonetic Alphabet.*****If you need to spell something out, you'll always have a way to clarify which letter you've said without having to think about it and it sounds more professional than "B as in boy, L as in...uhhh...Larry", etc.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet
LPT: When baking cookies, take them out when just the sides look almost done, not the middle. They'll finish baking on the pan and you'll have soft, delicious cookies.*****A lot of times baking instructions give you a bake time that leaves them in until the cookies are completely done baking. People then let the cookies rest after and they often get over-baked and end up crunchy, crumbly, or burnt.   So unless you like gross hard cookies, TAKE YOUR COOKIES OUT OF THE OVEN WHILE THE CENTER IS STILL GOOEY. I'M TIRED OF PEOPLE BRINGING HARD COOKIES TO POTLUCKS WHO DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THEIR COOKIES ARE ACTUALLY BURNT.  Edit: Okay this is getting wayyyyy more attention than I thought it would. I did not know cookies could be so extremely polarizing. I just want to say that I am not a baker, nor am I pro at life. I like soft cookies and this is how I like to get them to stay soft. With that being said, I understand that some people like hard cookies, chewy with a crunch, and many other varieties. There’s a lot of great cookie advice being given throughout this thread so find which advice caters to the kind of cookies you like and learn up! If not, add your own suggestion! Seeing a lot of awesome stuff in here.   I am accepting of all kinds of cookies. I just know some people have hard cookies when they wish they were soft so I thought I’d throw this up! 
LPT: If a News Headline Tells you How to Feel, it's Not News.*****If an article's title suggests how you ought to react to the content- that it's shocking or disgusting or heartwarming or threatening- it's not news, it's a propaganda piece at best and clickbait at worst. 
LPT: If you put melted cheese in the bottom of a taco first, the shell won't split.*****
LPT, Whenever taking photos you plan on photoshoping. I.e. wedding photos. before you move everyone into the photo take a photo of Just the background. it can make editing the photo alot easier in the later. like removing that annoying friend of the friend.*****
LPT: If you're in a job interview and you're offered a glass of water, always accept. If you're asked a tough question, you can take a sip and get yourself some extra seconds to think of a response*****
LPT: Add a site's name after your Gmail address to track who's selling your data. Eg: registering with john.doe+amazon@gmail.com sends all email to John.doe@gmail.com This way when you get spam, look at the 'to' in the email, it should have john.doe+amazon@gmail.com, revealing Amazon sold your data*****
LPT: Before checking in at the airport. take a photograph of your luggage. A picture is worth a thousand words if your bag gets lost!*****This has saved my family a couple of times... If you can't find your bags it's a lot easier just to show the baggage claim representative a picture of your luggage, then try to describe it to them.
LPT: if you are buying something high quality, prefer material over brand. For example, a good merino wool pair of sock will be almost certainly better than a fancy cotton one. Or a good full grain leather belt will be almost certainly better than a fancy genuine leather one.*****Of course, if budget allows, you can choose both material and brand for maximum quality.
LPT: In the tech field, learning to use simple analogies to explain complex processes will get you far in your career, since many managers in tech usually don't understand tech.*****
LPT: Struggle with actually going to the gym? Instead of taking rest days at home, take your rest day at the gym and just stretch. Even if its only 10-30 minutes, actually going to the gym will keep ypu in the routine to go every day.*****
LPT: Reminder. Monday is Memorial Day, not Veterans Day. Don’t thank servicemen/women for their service on Memorial Day*****I’ve seen this advise on this ~~thread~~ subreddit before but it’s always a good reminder. This weekend is about fallen soldiers and most of the men and women in our armed services will be remembering the people they have lose and would want the focus to stay on them. Some of them may have survivors guilt or other issues and thanking them might bring that back up. The day to celebrate our veterans is Veterans Day, or any other day of the year for that matter. The one day we shouldn’t celebrate them is Memorial Day.
LPT request : Do not request one hour dry cleaning if you can help it.*****As a dry cleaner, I can tell you that it take an average of 1 1/2 hours for a proper dry cleaning cycle to complete: a double bath (rinse and cleaning with detergent) and a drying cycle. If a dry cleaner is offering an hour service, something was skipped.  It take an average of 110 seconds to press a pair of pants, so take that into consideration too. That is if all the stains came out on the first try. Most likely, they need to be spot treated on the spotting board by a professional spotter to remove some stubborn stains. And that may or may not need to be cleaned again with pre-spot spray treatments to get that last stain out. Usually, a dry cleaner who offers  an hour service have to shorten the washing cycle and skip pressing the clothes and just steam them while on a hanger to get them out on time. They have to also make time for tagging, bagging and racking and inputting the order into a computer or some system for pickups. In summary, dry cleaning itself needs to be done in 45 minutes (2-3 min rinse and 35 mins for drying and the rest for extraction spinning and cool down) and the rest for processing if the staff is on top of things. Before, it was possible cause Perc was a strong enough chemical to wash like water, but most dry cleaners have switched over to an alternative dry cleaning solvents away from Perc by now, especially in California.  So if you want your money's worth, do not ask for an hour of dry cleaning. (I've been in the business for 16 years. )
LPT: When you hear that someone has said something negative about your character, resist the temptation to disparage them, too. Instead, mention something you like about them. Keeping a cool head and refusing to descend into pettiness can discredit the other’s unflattering remarks about you.*****
LPT: If you're ever in a car crash don't tell anyone the accident was your fault even if you think it might be. Do not sign any document unless it's for the police or your insurance agent.*****This is why you have an insurance company. Let them handle it. The more you say at the scene, the more problems you might cause in your defense later. Be polite, but when it comes to assessing what happened its best to stay quiet.  Take photos of all vehicles involved and the accident scene and help anyone who might be injured, if it is safe to do so.   You may think that the crash was 100% your fault and later learn that there were other factors that contributed to the crash that were outside of your control.  **- Not a Lawyer (TM)**
LPT: Modems are the biggest racket in the cable business. Don't opt for theirs, you pay $12/month for life, as apposed to the one time cost of $30 - $100. Only set up required is giving the ISP the Mac address on the box, and you dont have to wait for the installer to come "between 8am and 2pm"*****I used to work for an ISP B2B sales team. They paid us well for selling rented Modems because usually they were used, given back by the last renter. Or if they renter didn't return them, they still have to replace it with a new one. So it was recurring revenue without a cost to the ISP   And no, there is no advantage to renting. They don't service Modems rented differently than one you bought ___________________  Edit: To address everyone saying that their ISP "requires" use of the company's router, or that techs cost money:  Ive seen reps say the ISP modem rental was required, thats pushy sales tactics -most of the time. Just tell them emphatically you want to buy your own. **The router/modem model is important, make sure you ask your ISP what model/combo to buy**  Techs are no cost when its first installed because its the outside lines, into your house. The same goes for internet issues. You again, emphatically tell customer care that the issue is not with the hardware but with the wiring outside/to your box. They are pushy, like the car repair business. They know most people dont know better, so they embellish on facts and swindle a lot of people out of money due to ignorance   
LPT: If you have a chore that you actually enjoy, never tell anyone you enjoy it.*****1.  You'll do that chore for the rest of your days, even if you stop enjoying it 2.  You get no credit for doing that chore, since its really not even a chore, right!?
LPT: If you’ve made a mistake/ screwed up already, STRONGLY fight the temptation to over-explain/ justify what happened. Own up to it, offer to make up for it, and move on.*****
LPT: did you buy a 6-pack of cans with the plastic tie holding them together? Do a bird, turtle, or fish a favor and snip the circular loops before throwing it out so they don’t get caught up in it.*****Cans often come held together by plastic loops. [Turtles](https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/2617606/size/tmg-facebook_social.jpg) and [birds](http://myimages.bravenet.com/337/463/131/4/plasticstuckonbill.jpg) can get caught in them. It takes 2 seconds to snip the loops before throwing it out. Do it!  EDIT: Went to bed and woke up on the front page. Holy cow, thanks Reddit!   EDIT EDIT: always recycle obviously. But also cut them as a precaution. Also they’re biodegradable but again it’s a precaution. 
LPT: If you use your laptop for work, create a separate user for presentations. This will prevent embarrassing pop-ups or web history showing up.*****
LPT: if there are no chances for job growth or improvement - it's time to move on. You are worth more the more you learn. Otherwise you are getting paid less the more you know.*****
LPT: if you’re cooking something and have already added enough salt but it’s still “missing something,” add some lemon/lime juice or a splash of vinegar.*****Often times the “thing” that the dish is missing is acidity and a small splash of something acidic can really add a lot of depth to a dish.  Edit: people keep saying “or just add this.” What I mean is that if you have already added all additional spices/flavor/fat to the dish, and it still feels like it’s missing something, then look to add something acidic. Not just salt and vinegar lol.
LPT: Don't waste time with ctrl-alt-delete to click "Task Manager." Rather, ctrl-shift-esc opens Task Manager in Windows directly.*****Edit: to those of you claiming that this doesn't save time, perhaps you're correct that any one particular shortcut doesn't save time, but any power user will tell you that if you build up muscle memory it's exponentially faster to navigate a computer with a keyboard than a mouse. That's partially why platforms like Vim and Emacs are so popular.  Also please stop commenting that you can "just right click the task bar." Literally every other comment is this.
LPT: On a Windows system, hit Win+R and type "shutdown -t x" where x stands for a time in seconds to automatically shutdown your computer after a given time. Perfect if you just want to finish this one youtube video before going to bed, but tend to usually watch another 20.*****I know the situation too well where "just one more reddit post" turns into a 3 A.M. binge session.   If I feel like my browsing time is getting out of hands again, I usually look at the clock, round up to a nice, even number and set the shutdown time for the difference in seconds.   Say it's 11:52 pm, I type "shutdown -t 480" and keep browsing until my PC forces me to quit at exactly midnight.  Windows will notify you 2 minutes before it finally shuts down, and if you changed your mind you can issue the command "shutdown -a" to cancel the shutdown process.  edit:  /u/Patrikco made a neat website which calculates the time difference for you  http://www.shutdownti.me/
LPT: When receiving a gift card as a gift, take a picture of what you bought with the card and send it with the thank you text or email. It makes their generosity much more meaningful and shows appreciation.*****
LPT: If you are going on a blind date or meeting someone for the first time in person, set an alarm on your phone that will go off about 25-30 minutes in and have it set to your phone's ringtone. You can pretend it is a call and be able to have an excuse to leave if you need to without being rude.*****Edit: Some of y'all are actually big mad and trying to police my post. I never said you had to ghost them after. I never said abandon them and be an asshole. Some people just aren't very good under the pressure of the situation to be honest and say they're not interested. A lot of the time people will text after and say they didn't feel chemistry or aren't interested. I am someone who is too nervous to speak much at all on the first encounter, let alone say I'm not interested and leave. If you have the courage to stand up on a date and tell the girl "yeah I'm not feeling this" and leave then good for you but some people are too shy to do that.   Edit 2: Someone actually took the time to send me a message and tell me to kill myself. My LPT is rude but telling me to kill myself isn't? Lol. Just downvote and move on 
LPT: Get the originals over low-fat versions of food. After taking out the fat, food tastes terrible, so the companies pump it full of sugar to make up for it. Sugar contributes more to weight gain than fat does.*****I'm referring mainly to America here as most int'l nations likely have more clear packaging and branding, but I can't say for sure  Edit: Not all products are like this. Always be sure to check the label.  Edit 2: Skim milk is not like this.  Edit 3: for those of you saying "Calories are all that matters" and "fat has more calories than sugar", you should know that not all calories are processed the same. Google "why a calorie is not a calorie".
LPT: Genuinely caring about somebody a lot, does not guarantee they care about you equally (or at all) in return. Some people will never care about you regardless of what you do or say. So don't assume somebody appreciates you just because you do nice things for them.*****This is something that I unfortunately didn't learn until well into adulthood - It may sound obvious when its spelled out, but when you're in the actual situation its not always so clear.  Most of my life I thought if I really cared about somebody a lot, then they must care about me to some degree in return. It always felt like that connection was so strong it had to be mutual, even if the obvious signs showed otherwise. Despite certain people treating me like dirt and rarely reciprocating, I would do everything I could to make them happy. I would go out of my way to help them, say & do nice things for them, encourage them, etc..with the assumption they'd eventually show their appreciation for me being in their lives.  I'd think "how could they not care about me when I make it so obvious how much I care about them? If I just keep trying they'll come around".  This was especially true for people who maybe showed signs they cared at some point in the past, but weren't anymore.  What I've learned over the years is that a lot of times that reciprocal connection is imagined. The amount you love somebody does not always affect how much they love you back. People can and will use you and your emotions. And just because somebody may have once cared about you in the past, doesn't mean they still do now or ever will again in the future...theres often nothing you can do to change their feelings through any good deeds or kind words.   I'm not talking about classic "nice guy" syndrome. Not the crush who friend-zoned you that you're desperately trying to win over by being nice when there should have never been any expectation of feelings to begin with...I'm talking about people who you genuinely feel a meaningful connection with. Whether that be friends, family, or romantic partners.  I wasted a lot of time on people expecting them to suddenly start reciprocating my feelings and actions. I'd be convinced I could win people over (or back over)...including bad friends and former relationships...if I was just nice enough to them and let my feelings be known. Looking back I should have cut my loses far sooner. I should have focused more on finding people who not only cared about me, but wanted to make me happy in return.  Its important not to assume somebody appreciates you just because you love them and do good things for them.You can waste a lot of time and energy focusing on people who will never really care no matter what you do.  *********  **Edit** I should note, I don't mean to say you should only do good things for people if you expect something in return. There is nothing wrong with being nice to people just because it makes you happy (even if they don't appreciate it). But you can't expect them to some day change their minds. And you shouldn't let your desire to please people who don't care about you distract you from finding people who do.

LPT: Your hearing is not invincible. Please lower your volume when listening to music. Bring earplugs to concerts. Do not make the same mistake I made.*****Your hair cells are fragile. Protect them. I made the mistake of listening to music and pretty much anything at unsafe levels. Now, I pay the price of having an endless phantom ringing noise in my ear, also known as tinnitus.  This will get lost, but, at the very least, some people will see this and correct this mistake I made.   Here is a [link to relative noise volumes](https://www.chem.purdue.edu/chemsafety/Training/PPETrain/dblevels.htm). Also, when you're outside in a bustling city or on a subway, you might decide to turn up your volume to high and unsafe levels so that your music overpowers the noise around you; don't do this.   For those who don't know what [tinnitus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIAjJogJ0cs) is. There are many forms of tinnitus. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=059qOMgLa_o) is but one of them.   EDIT: I'm glad this is reaching many people. If you have friends or family members, please inform them as well. I often think about why many of us are never taught about the importance of protecting our ears. If you can hear someone's music through their earbuds, then it is most likely far too loud. If you google "tinnitus definition" and you expand the definition box, you will see that it's been on the rise lately.   "[The U.S. Centers for Disease Control estimates that nearly 15% of the general public — over 50 million Americans — experience some form of tinnitus. Roughly 20 million people struggle with burdensome chronic tinnitus, while 2 million have extreme and debilitating cases.](https://www.ata.org/understanding-facts)"   Stay safe everyone.   EDIT 2: Hello everyone, I've been seeing a lot of post here. Thanks for sharing for anecdotes and informing others of how your tinnitus came to be. Just a few things to keep in mind. Not all tinnitus is caused by hearing loss or loud  noise. Tinnitus can occur if you're sick, or if you have an ear infection, **earwax buildup**  or even through medication, or in rare cases if you have TMJ. In these cases they may or may not be permanent (I don't want to scare you), and I would highly recommend going to your ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat Doctor) as soon as possible. Also remember that just because there isn't a cure for tinnitus does not mean there may be professional treatment out there that can significantly improve your quality of life. This is important to remember. See your ENT to get these ruled out!   As /u/OhCleo mentioned, don't clean your ears by putting cotton sticks in your ear canal. This is how you cause earwax blockage.   Edit3: I've been reading all of your comments. Here I will include some notable suggestions I've read but may be lost in the pool of comments we have. 1) also wear earplugs while motorcycling, drumming, if you're a musician, .   2) ***don't wear earplugs all the time, only when necessary***; wearing earplugs for too long can also damage your ears.   3) **there are earplugs called ~~"Etymotic"~~(just search for "earplugs that don't muffle sound") earplugs or musician earplugs that actually keep the sounds the same, and in some cases even help sounds sound better but at a lower volume** 4) listening to music for too long even at medium volume can still cause damage, take breaks.   /u/ukralibre said "Thats interesting but its almost impossible to convince people to use protection before they get harmed." However, by then it'll be too late. Take all these anecdotes from your fellow redditors and heed this LPT.   Edit 4: I put more emphasis on not wearing earplugs all the time only when necessary because that's important. It can lead to hyperacusis. You want to protect your ears from loud noises, not every noise.   Edit 5: For many of us tinnitus redditors, if you already have it, it's not as bad as it sounds. Have you ever smelled something that smelled awful initially but after a while you don't even notice it anymore? Or that car smell that you recognize when you first enter a car but after a while inside the car it just "disappears". Same with your tinnitus, only it'll take a little bit longer than that.  Our brains are amazing and have crazy adaptive capabilities, also known as [brain plasticity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaDlLD97CLM). Your brain will begin to ignore the phantom ringing, but the ringing itself will not subside. I know how ludicrous this sound, but I have I personally have habituated to the sound myself, and I'm pretty much back to my normal life. Things like stress and caffeine can cause a spike in your T. For now, use background noise like rain drops, or white noise, perhaps a 10 hour video of a busy cafe (on safe volumes, of course). As always, seek medical or professional help nonetheless. 
LPT: At Taco Bell, 4 mini quesadillas is cheaper than 1 regular one and is nearly twice as much food*****Each mini quesadilla is almost twice as big as one slice of a regular quesadilla, which has four slices. Where I live, a regular is $4.30 and a mini is $1
LPT: If someone randomly brings up something in a conversation, pay good attention to them because they probably had it on there mind for a while.*****
LPT - Know the difference between state parks and state forests. It's often free to camp in a state forest, but not in a state park.*****Particularly good to know for those in the East, without access to BLM land.  National forests are a thing, as well.
LPT: Go to the zoo when it is a little cool outside. The animals will be active trying to warm up.*****
LPT: If an estranged friend starts casually reaching out periodically, listen a bit more closely, ask and keep the conversation going. It could mean something more.*****My very close (at the time) high school friend started reaching out not too long ago. He would usually text me or chat me at work, mostly about catching up, current political affairs, or to discuss science. I was usually busy or distracted and would not do my best to follow up with him.  He died today. Won't discuss the details but it was not of natural causes.   If it seems unusual, give him or her the proper time of day. Otherwise you will have to carry this wrenching feeling of knowing you could have done something more. Stay safe, and don't be afraid to ask directly for help if you need it.  *Just wanted to add, thank you for all your kind words, messages and support. If I could siphon them and somehow make their way to his parents I would. Goodness knows they need it more than I do.   If you are feeling suicidal, call 1-800-273-8255. There is no shame in this, never. If you are having substance abuse problems,  1-800-662-4537. https://www.addictioncenter.com/  Addiction is a disease. There is no shame in seeking help. It's hard to do this alone, and you are not. Please, take care of yourselves. You can do this.
LPT: If you find yourself lacking motivation to do anything, try just taking a shower and making your bed. The feeling of accomplishment and being clean will tremendously help your state of mind and can easily motivate you to be even more productive.*****Edit: Obviously for those who have depression or other mental health issues, this isn't some magic cure and won't necessarily work. No need for attacks and insults, this does work for lots of people.
LPT: After college, once you get the first job, start looking for a better job after a year or two. Don't stay out of loyalty.*****Because trust me, no company is loyal to their employees. Be respectful and professional, but loyalty in a company is rarely noticed and appreciated - unless maybe if its your dad's company.   As a person who has worked for a same company for 6 years after graduating, i found out i didn't get a single raise within it unless i ask for it every fucking year, never got much other benefit than initially signed while studying at school.   So i started applying for 5 months and finally got a job, it pays me almost 5 (edit: 4 is more accurate+ benefits such as health care, lunch, gym etc...) times as much as i used to. My friend from same school, with same seniority was getting 4 times my salary for the last 2 years already.   My mistake was thinking that being loyal to this company was gonna in return make the company loyal to me, the company only wants lower costs, loyalty has no place here.   Edit: wow, didn't expect this response, also apparently this is very common in IT sector (but applies to pretty much all industry), and i am in the IT sector :/ - still feels so unfair.   Edit 2 : as some pointed out, try not to be a "job hopper", this depends heavily on the industry you are working in though.   Edit 3: this is not a golden a rule, use your own brain, only you know your situation best - just don't let loyalty for a company ever be the biggest priority, your career should be your priority.
LPT: Whenever someone had a bad day and they’re being cathartic, just listen. Don’t speak. Don’t give advice. Don’t interrupt. Don’t pretend to listen. Be a pal and be a sponge. This is the most good you can do.*****
LPT: When you have no cell service (multiple bars of service but nothing works) at a crowded event, turn off LTE in cellular settings. Phone will revert to a slower, but less crowded, 3G signal.*****Carriers use multiple completely different frequencies for different generations of cellular technology.  Since the vast majority of people have phones that support LTE (the fastest available now) this network will get clogged first, but the legacy network on different spectrum is indifferent to congestion on the LTE network.
LPT: Next time you have an easily googleable question about food, clothes, or general life stuff, text your Mom and ask her instead. She probably loves seeing that you still want her advice.*****This is something I've been doing lately just because I feel like my mom seems happier when I do. I'm in my last year of college and realized I typically just google'd all my questions that I had as I figure out living on my own. This past year though, I've been texting her all my silly little questions: "How can I get X stain out of my carpet easily?"  "Do you know any home-remedies for a sore throat?"  It might seem really trivial, but I think anyone would love to know that you still rely on them and not only appreciate their advice, but seek it out too.   Have a great day! :)  EDIT: Obligatory thanks for the gold, kind stranger. Glad I could brighten your days! 
LPT: While talking to anyone cross-eyed / lazy eyed / anything else that makes eye contact difficult, look at the bridge of their nose. You appear to be making eye contact with them without having to worry about making either of you uncomfortable*****
LPT: Use the recycle air feature on your cars AC system! Instead of constantly fighting to cool the hot air outside, it will cool the already cooled air inside your car. Saving gas, and cooling your car faster.*****I notice many of my family and friends never use this feature! I don’t recommend using it while smoking because it will stink up your vents. Hope this helps anyone trying to stay cool! Also, if your cars AC sucks... look into getting an Ac re-charge kit. It will refill the refrigerant in your cars AC unit.
LPT: When you're talking about someone who isn't present, talk about things they're good at or things that you appreciate about them. This is called good gossip. By practicing this, you're not only being very kind to them but your mood will also increase because you're expressing gratitude.*****
LPT: If you're going to have a surprise party for someone, make sure the cover story has them dressed appropriately.*****For my wife's surprise party, she thought we were on our way to an art opening. She dressed very nicely, and later told me that she was very happy that she'd dressed up.
LPT: If you are near a university's campus in spring, check near the dorms for items that the students leave when they break up for summer. Many don't want to take home larger items if they live far away from campus, so you could pick up some nice stuff that was left on the curb for trash.*****
LPT: Every time you are about to buy something and instead decide to save the money, transfer that exact amount to savings with a memo of what you were going to buy.*****This gives you immediate positive feedback when you watch your savings grow a little bit, and gives you further incentive to make similar decisions in the future.
LPT: When you finish a jar of jalapenos, save the juice and refill the jar with dill pickles. Wait a few days, and you'll have spicy dill pickles.*****Edit: Adios, inbox. To save a lot of people the trouble of telling me to just buy spicy pickles, they're not available in this country.
LPT: Picking out a gift? Find an item they "need", but don't think is high priority. Often, it's something that they really want to get for themselves, but think there are "more important" things to spend money on. Getting those "lower priority" items as gifts relieves stress and saves them cash.*****
LPT: pay attention to the end of prices while shopping at Costco*****>In particular, look for:  >Prices that end in 97¢: These have been marked down from the regular priced items, which end in 99¢   >Odd pricing, such as 79¢, 49¢, or 89¢: These indicate specially priced items that Costco got a deal on from the manufacturer. These can be better deals than at other stores, but not usually better than the 97¢ markdown.   >An asterisk* on the upper right side of the sign: The item won't be reordered.   >88¢ or .00 endings: Manager markdowns. They use these to move a product very fast.  Credit to u/almisamie
LPT: Looking for some Christmas Magic? The International Space Station orbits the earth 15 times a day and can easily be confused with Santa's Sleigh by excited children in December*****This does require preparation. That tiny station is rarely streaking directly overhead at an ideal time, so you might need to be flexible or wait for a better opportunity in the future.   * First you will want to find some dark skies near you with a website like: http://darksitefinder.com/maps/world.   * Next, Check this: https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/sightings/ and put in your chosen location to see when the ISS passes overhead.    * And then, a few days before, You will want to check the night sky forecast at http://www.cleardarksky.com/csk/ to check on cloud cover.  It's rare but some people will get that perfect Santa flying overhead on Chrismas Eve but for others, you can say something along the lines of "*I got a hot tip that Santa is doing his famous practice run to stretch the reindeers legs before the big night...*"   Credit to [this article](https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/internet/space-station-santas-sleigh-uk-christmas-eve-3592059/) for inspiring this post.
LPT; De-Escalating a Karen***** TL:DR; when you’re a bystander in a victim/harasser conflict, a good way to de escalate and show support is to engage in friendly conversation with the victim. Especially if you aren’t comfortable engaging the aggressor.   At the checkout line, the cashier was a little inexperienced and was having trouble with her machine. As she waited for help I smiled at her and patiently waited, noticing that she was becoming more flustered as people began queuing behind me. An older gentleman put his groceries on the belt and began to complain loudly and rudely about how long this was taking. I don’t normally think of a good way to approach awkward social situations but something in my brain clicked that day. As she became more uncomfortable and flustered I shifted slightly between them and began complimenting the cashier’s curly hair (mine is naturally curly as well and it can be a pain). I kept her engaged in conversation until a manager arrived and fixed her computer.  You don’t have to engage the harasser to show someone you have their back.  Edit; For those in the comments saying I should have called the guy out; I am 5 feet tall and somewhat introverted. Confronting this person for his rude behavior was not something I could have handled well.  I do not trust people to not be violent and I preferred not to draw any attention to myself. This advice was meant for those who are not comfortable with direct confrontation.  Second Edit; I used Karen to mean ‘dealing with an unhappy customer’. This tip could work with whichever gender.
LPT: If your job requires a lot of walking, bring an extra pair of socks. It's amazing what a difference a fresh pair of socks can make in the middle of a long shift*****
LPT: Universities like MIT offer free online courses for subjects like Computer Science, Engineering, Psychology and more that include full lectures and exams*****I stumbled upon https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/find-by-topic/ earlier and have been watching videos on programming in Python. A lot of subjects are covered and it's all free. Happy learning!  Edit: Thanks for the gold, y'all!
Lpt: go to a community college for a few years and then transfer to uni after you reach the maximum transferable credit limits. You'll save about 50% on tuition depending on your state*****
LPT: Gentlemen, it’s three days till Valentines Day. Trim your nails now!*****Your partner will appreciate it. Freshly cut nails are very sharp and will be smooth after a few days.
LPT: never fill in those free raffles that you see in shopping centres giving away cool things like free holidays and free cars. These companies are data mining firms, and they pass on your information to call centres, marketing firms and even government agencies all without your permission.*****
LPT: When unsubscribing from a service online, take a screen shot of the finalized screen as proof in the event they try to bill you again against your will.*****
LPT: Hit "s" while watching netflix on a computer to skip the intro.*****I absolutely hate having to move my cursor or my mouse to skip the intro and hitting S is super easy and quick. God bless for the skip intro button tho. 
LPT: If there is a persistent foul smell in your kitchen that remains after you've seemingly cleaned everything, check the filter to the fan above your stove. This is meant to funnel most fumes to an outside vent, but like any filter it can get saturated over time.*****
LPT: If you don't have a dog and are feeling lonely, local rescues are ALWAYS looking for volunteer dog walkers*****You'll refill your happiness meter in no time AND do some good/make a cooped up dog's day!
LPT set a nearby shop as your home address in your vehicle's nav. If someone were to steal your car, the last thing you want is for them to have directions to your house with a set of keys/garage door opener.*****
LPT: If you have a friend or family member that provides a professional service (legal, medical, accounting, etc), always offer to pay for their service. Don't assume that they will help you for free.*****My in-laws are accountants and we were talking about taxes this past weekend. Since I just started a business, I asked if I could hire them to prepare my taxes. The response I received was very eye opening; my mother-in-law said, "I'll take care of it and give you the family discount, but I want to thank you for offering to pay...most of the family EXPECT us to do their taxes for free."  EDIT: Obligatory "I can't believe I made the front page of Reddit!" - I'll be sure to tell my mother-in-law (to which I'm sure she'll reply, "huh?"   Sorry if I didn't include your profession, but I love hearing all the responses. On a personal note, my father was in the trades and would always help out friends/family/neighbors with simple repairs. However, in return, he would always ask if they could donate their time to [Habitat For Humanity](http://www.habitat.org/) for a local build. Don't want to get to preachy, but [HFH](http://www.habitat.org/) is a really great organization and if you ever get a chance to volunteer on a build, I highly recommend it.  EDIT2: Great replies, keep 'em coming! Apparently, IT professionals are in demand and tired of hearing, "I have one small favor to ask you..." from friends/family.  For those who think expecting to get paid is greedy, I would advise to at least offer some food, gas or you could trade services. My father once helped a welder remodel his bathroom and in exchange he received a new wood stove for the sauna.
LPT: A real, effective apology has three parts: (1) Acknowledge how your action affected the person; (2) say you're sorry; (3) describe what you're going to do to make it right or make sure it doesn't happen again. Don't excuse or explain.*****Most people treat an apology as a way to explain their point of view. But that feels to the listener like making excuses or minimizing their experience.   Say your roommate accidentally ruins your  couch by spilling a big cup of coffee on it. Think about which you'd rather hear.   Mediocre apology:  "I'm so sorry! I just got startled when my phone buzzed and I accidentally knocked it over. It was totally an accident. I feel terrible."  Good apology: "I know you really like the look of that couch, and now it's got a stain on it - you must be really bummed about that. I'm so sorry. I'd be happy to pay for a cleaning, and in the future, I'll keep my drinks in the kitchen.   Edit: Reading through the comments, I think I should clarify. I'm talking about situations where you feel bad about something you did or said, and want to clear the air with an apology. This is not applicable to situations where you feel you did nothing wrong, or don't want to apologize.   Edit 2.  Well. Had I known anyone would actually read this, I probably would have put some time into thinking of some better examples! I'm super new to reddit, so this has been interesting.   I went though the first couple hundred responses and got some rough numbers, as follows:  1. This is a pretty good idea, I will contribute some further thoughts or information: 12%  2. I like this. Nothing further. 11%  3. This is the right idea, but Jesus H. Christ, your examples are terrible. 8%  4. I will tell a joke. 7%  5. You gotta have some explanation, or else how are they supposed to know what you're apologizing for? 7%  6. I wish [person in my life] did this. 7%  7. You plagiarized this from Jimmy John's/Dr. Laura/Daniel Tiger/other. 7%  8. You gotta also do something else (ask forgiveness, actually do something to make amends, etc.). 7%  9. And for the love of FSM, never say "I'm sorry you feel that way" or "I'm sorry, but..." because that's awful. 6%  10.Apologizing sucks. 6%  11. This would not be appropriate for every situation. 5%  12. This is a terrible idea. 4%   13. Something about Trump. 3%  14. I have my Google JD and/or my cousin's wife's stepmom is a lawyer, and therefore I have determined that you'll be legally liable. 3%  15. Here's a link you won't click. 3%   16. This is just as stupid and repetitive as the rest of the thoughtless dreck on this wasteland of a sub. I'M LEAVING. 3%  17. You are a robot/HR person/narcissist/ neckbeard fuckboy/passive-aggressive jerk. 2%  Percentages rounded. 
LPT: If you're watching a video that's required for school/college and really aren't liking it, just increase the speed. It might take a little getting used to but once you get the hang of it, you can watch boring vidoes two times faster.*****
LPT: Bring a healthy snack to work. If you're looking for a snack but don't feel like eating the one you brought, you're not hungry you're bored.*****
LPT: Find 3 hobbies, 1 to make you money, 1 to keep you in shape, and 1 that let you be creative.*****
LPT: Never take a problem to your boss until you have multiple solutions to it.*****It may seem obvious to some but imagine the difference between an employee coming to you with a problem that you then have to figure out how to solve VS an employee coming to you with a problem they already have several solutions for and you simply need to choose (as the manager) which option you believe is best.   In my experience when most employees come across a problem they don't know how to instantly solve they simply present it to their manager and wait for a response.   This does nothing other than concrete your managers opinion that you are unable to do their job and they subconsciously disqualify you from promotion, presenting them with multiple solutions to a problem however makes them feel they are in control whilst simultaneously considering you as an asset worthy of promotion or at the very least retention.  Edit: Couple of things that have come up  1. Time frame - I wasn't suggesting withholding critical information from your superior, if you have 30 seconds to tell them, come up with some ideas in that 30 seconds, even if they are bad ideas it shows you are willing to employ critical thinking in important situations. You can teach someone with bad ideas how to improve them, you can't teach someone with no ideas how to have them.  2. Trivial Matters - Obviously don't bother your boss with trivial decisions that are a normal part of your job, it should be clear based on the roles and responsibilities of your position which decisions need management oversight and which are well within your jurisdiction to make, if that distinction is unclear it is certainly something you should clarify with your manager.  3. You should just make the decision yourself - In many situations this is correct from a pure "efficiency" standpoint but often if you don't take things to a manager your solving them goes unnoticed and your clever decision making is superfluous, it is a fine line between irritating and impressing your manager and that line can vary wildly depending on the individual but generally speaking when combined with common sense it works.  4. Management Perspective - I AM NOT currently a manager, over the past 20 years I have bounced back and forth between employer/employee in different companies, combined roughly 8 years as a manager and 12 years as an employee, I am not complaining about my current situation, I am very happy and follow this LPT on a daily basis.  Edit 2: Thankyou all so much, I really didn't expect this and the different perspectives presented in this thread are mind blowing, the other LPT I follow is "Seek first to understand" and you have all helped me (and hopefully others) to do just that.    
LPT: When putting in time for vacation, always take the day after you get back off. This will give you a safety net in case your flight is cancelled. Otherwise you get a day to unpack and relax.*****
LPT: If something bad happens in your life, don't let it define who you are. Don't make it your excuse for not progressing yourself. Don't undermine it, learn from it, understand it, and let it be apart of you without it being who you are.*****Edit: I just want to say thank you to everyone who got something from this. That's all I wanted and I'm glad I could help a few people out today. :)
LPT: If you're nervous about asking your boss/potential employer about raises/salary, don't think of them as authority figures you hope will be more generous, think of them as customers who are buying your time.*****EDIT: Wow, I did not expect this to make it to the front page.   From what I'm seeing in the comments, a lot of redditors have some pretty terrible employers. IMO, if your relationship with your employer is so adversarial that their response to you knowing what you're worth and asking to get paid as such, is for them to fire you out of spite, I wouldn't be hanging around at that job even if they did give me the raise I want.  Some employers are great and will happily give you what you're worth, a lot of employers are scumbags who who try to milk you for everything you're worth while paying you jack shit, but plenty of employers are simply businessmen trying to get the best value for their buck, but will pay a valuable employee what they're worth if it makes good business sense.
LPT: Before submitting an online form where you've typed out a long question or details, copy that section to your clipboard before hitting submit. If there is a problem with the website and that text is lost, you can quickly paste it back in when you try again instead of typing it out again.*****
LPT:If you have an option in high school/college, join the debating team! Public speaking and thinking on the spot are two of the most crucial skills to learn in life. You'll notice the difference in your day to day interactions!*****
LPT: Deer often hide/leave fawns in high grass at this time of the year. If you are mowing high grass with a Riding Mower or similar machine take extra time and check entire field before you start. If you do find one don't be afraid to move it, mama deer will not abandon fawn because of your scent!*****Edit: According to rural veterinarian we talked to over the weekend it is fairly common at this time of the year for people to bring in animals ( mainly fawns ) that were hit or even ran over by various lawn mowers. 
LPT: It’s FREE to go to the humane society and pet kitties—this can help someone who is unable to have pets and/or people who are chronically lonely.*****I do this often! All I do is walk in and ask the receptionist if I can come inside and pet the kitties. They *always* say yes!   I usually sit in the kitty room for an hour playing, petting, interacting, and bonding with them. The kitties love it because they need attention and I love it because I can tell how much they’re loving it.   For me, going there sets me happy for the rest of the day!  Sometimes you get to see them being picked to be adopted too, which always warms my heart. (:
LPT: Just because you got your first well paying job does not mean you need that $700 a month car loan. Save the money and get something that gets you from point A to point B.*****
LPT: There is a visible difference between not working out at all and doing 15 pushups every day. Make 15 push ups your new 'not working out'.*****If you do not work out, do 15 pushups every day. It does not sound like much but it makes a huge long term difference to not working out. It does not take long and it makes a visible difference.  If you struggle with 15, do 10. If 15 make you smile do 20.  Edit: Because of people messaging/commenting about injury and muscle imbalance: This is not meant to replace your workout routine nor is it meant to be your goto routine for the next 5 years.   The LPT is meant to be: Even a tiny workout can go a long way. Warm up. Mix it up. But don't think working out only works if you spend 3 days a week in the gym. There is a wide gap between not working out at all and doing 5-10 minutes every day. You can see that difference and you can feel it. Some say even a few dong chin ups every other day can go a long way ...
LPT: If you deal with multiple clients, figure out how they take their coffee and take notes. When meeting with them, get them coffee how they like it. It sets the meeting up to start on a good note.*****
LPT: If something in your oven catches on fire, DO NOT OPEN THE DOOR!*****Feeding flames with a rush of oxygen is the absolute last thing you want to do in this situation.  Instead, leave the door closed, turn off the oven, and watch for the fire to smother itself as the oxygen inside the oven depletes.  If the flames get worse or refuse to go out, leave the house and call the fire department.  Better to ruin your stove top than burn your entire home down.
LPT: Mention in your will that you want a cheap casket/gravestone*****Funeral Directors are businesses like any other and will usually prey upon mourning vulnerable loved ones. The family of the deceased feel bad "cheaping out" and will buy any expensive services suggested to them. Do your mourning family one last favour and take the choice away from them.  Or as /u/FluffyBlizzard suggests; just buy it beforehand.  EDIT: DeathProTip, AfterlifeProTip ..... please, no more.
LPT: If you can hear them but they can't hear you, you're the one with the weak signal.*****
LPT: Think of money in terms of hours. You make $10/hour and wanna buy that $150 coat? Is that coat really worth 15 hours of work?*****
LPT: If you are caring for an elderly or disabled family member, see if they qualify for In Home Support Services. IHSS will pay you about 2k for that care. They don’t advertise this because most family members will do it for free. This is California, not sure of similar programs in other states.*****
LPT: If you reach out to someone for help on a technical issue and they spend their valuable time helping you but are unable to resolve it, always try and let them know how it got resolved so they can help the next person with the same issue.*****
LPT: If you are the only one trying to maintain a friendship, they aren't your friend and your time and energy would be better spent somewhere else.*****EDIT: If someone is clearly depressed, prefers alone time, or needs your help before something bad happens, this is not the tip for you to follow. Please reach out to that person and let them know you care. I've been on that end and it is so reassuring to hear from someone even if you don't feel like being around anyone.  But if you have friends who you consistently try to make plans with, they decline or take a rain check with a "oh we'll have to hang out soon" and never get back with you, yet you see them out with other friends all the time, then yes, this is very applicable. You deserve better friends.
LPT: Don't have time to read the Terms and Privacy policies? Try tosdr.org website; It will provide ratings for the Terms and Privacy policies and will also provide you an overview of some of the main points that we need to look into.*****
LPT: If someone at a business hooks you up or gives you a freebie don't Yelp about it. It could cost them their job.*****
LPT: Never shake spices over a hot pan. The steam will enter the bottle causing the spice to go hard.*****
LPT: Write down great ideas when you get them; do that right away. You think you will never forget them, but you almost always will.*****
LPT: Never give an animal to someone as a gift, especially if they do not ask for one.*****Thrusting an animal on someone forces them to take care of another life but not everyone can afford to give it the life it deserves.  *edit: Wow! Front page. Thanks guys, I'm blown away at the response this has gotten.
LPT: At a restaurant, always wash your hands after ordering. Menus are generally the dirtiest thing you touch in a restaurant.*****
LPT: Dont know if your house is the only one without power? Check surrounding WiFi networks, if none are showing up, your house isnt the only one*****EDIT1: I think some people are getting the wrong message. This really only applies to suburban residents, and is only particularly useful when it is day time. Nevertheless, I understand the controversy. This LPT is only for a select few, sorry if it doesn't apply to you
LPT: Dial a number with an extension often? Save the number with two commas between them. Example: 555-555-5555,, 123456*****If you put two commas after the phone number followed by the extension, your phone will call the number, pause, then dial the extension.   Edit 1: Thanks to u/vonaudy who explained how it works. Each comma is 2 second pause, so you can place 3 commas to have it wait 6 seconds before sending the extension.  You could also take multiple breaks like  555-555-5555,,7,,,,,45,,7890#  And thanks to u/bizzattles for mentioning the semi colon which prompts you on screen to send the extension when you want to.  Edit 2: credit to u/provanilla. To get the comma key when on the dial pad, you need to press and hold the * key.  Edit 3: removed spaces after commas. Stupid phone...  Edit 4: Thanks for the Platinum and gold kind strangers.
LPT: If you are feeling down and have a neighbour with a dog, see it you can take it for a walk. Dogs love to be walked and it can help out the neighbour too. You also get a new friend and go outdoors.*****I've been having a tough time recently and doing this has helped me a lot.   Edit: I just wanted to say that, even though they are just random internet points, it makes me feel good that this post did so well and that there have been so many nice comments. I hope that this advice might help someone.   Also thank you for the comments about the animal shelters and the dog walking apps. I had not though about those options and they are great ideas!!  Thanks for the gold!
LPT: Don't walk your dog on roads and walks where rock salt is used to melt snow and ice, it will cut up the pads on your dogs paws*****
LPT: When someone offers to do something nice for you, like pay for dinner or help carry a heavy item, let them. When you refuse someone's kindness you're denying their opportunity to experience the joy of giving.*****You're also denying yourself the experience of receiving kindness. It's easy to think that by refusing help you're not imposing or being a burden. But accepting kindness with gratefulness and appreciation is always the better path. 
LPT: If you have a clogged drain use baking soda and vinegar to dissolve the clog and flush with boiling water to avoid buying expensive drain cleaners.*****
LPT: Tell your parents/grandparents to call your phone number immediately if they ever get a call saying that you need money.*****Scammers will call older people and try to make it sound like their son/daughter is in trouble and they need some amount of money wired to a weird address. By having them call your phone number if they ever get a call like this, it will prevent them from losing money or having their identity stolen. 
LPT: Feeling dread because you're alone on Thanksgiving? Go help serve food at the local church, synagogue, rotary, homeless shelter, whatever. People will thank you, and you'll be able to give and receive genuine love all day long.*****You can show up at any time. We're all wondering where you are. Grab an apron. Hurry up!
LPT: If you apply for a job and are successful, keep a copy of the job advert somewhere. It can help with updating your cv at a later date.*****
LPT - When at a pub in the U.K., if they serve food but the table has no cutlery or napkins set then you need to order at the bar.*****
LPT: keep your bedroom windows closed for about a day after the rain has stopped to prevent terrifying spiders from taking up residency.*****Edit: to answer many of you, yes I actually do have one screen on a small window that I leave open. I close all the others though.   The thing is, I live in South Africa and I've only ever seen like one other person with a screen so I thought my advice was helpful.  Also, the worst, common spiders we get here are [rain spiders] (https://www.google.co.za/search?q=rain+spiders&client=ms-android-xiaomi&prmd=ivn&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjt4KX_z9vXAhXiDsAKHc8GCSoQ_AUIEigB&biw=360&bih=564), which are not dangerous but fucking scary. Also moths and [christmas beetles] (https://www.google.co.za/search?q=Christmas+beetles&client=ms-android-xiaomi&prmd=ivn&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiU4cT10dvXAhVsB8AKHWRoD7YQ_AUIEigB&biw=360&bih=564) can stay out too please.   Edit 2: thanks for the links to r/spiderbro could help me get over my fears. awesome sub.   Edit 3: links added. beatles --> beetles lol  
LPT: When you're the new kid on the block in a high-value situation (e.g., a new job), keep your good ideas to yourself until you get the lay of the political/social landscape.*****There can be buried landmines in some of the unlikeliest places and, if you step on one early in your time somewhere, your inadvertent faux pas may follow you there *forever,* because that will be the lasting impression that people will have of you. Or it may just get you outright fired.
LPT: If you are getting rid of a lot of blankets, towels, dressing gowns or any kind of large fabric, consider donating them to your pets vet or a local animal shelter. They are always in need of blankets for the animals.*****
LPT: Save the packing list from your camping trip. When you get home, add the things you forgot, remove what you brought but didn't need and then save the list for your next trip.*****Edit: Yes, there are many exceptions to this rule: Foul weather gear, first aid kit, bear spray, etc.  All good points.
LPT: Always keep one extra day off from your vacation schedule to adjust back to daily life.*****
LPT: If you have a favorite movie you’ve seen several (or hundreds) of times, try watching it with subtitles/closed captioning on. You might be surprised just how many lines you heard wrong or missed entirely.*****It is especially useful for content dense movies, ie. Saving Private Ryan. If you are a fan of the movie I highly recommend starting with this one... total game changer for me.  EDIT UPDATE:  Many have pointed out the subtitles are only as good as the people typing them, but after a lot feedback from industry professionals I thinks the odds are very good the subtitles are more adequate than my ability to hear it correctly without them.  Also, there seem to be some downers who “who have been doing this for years”, and to you I say, why didn’t you share your LPT sooner?? I could have been doing this for YEARS.  EDIT UPDATE 2:  Thank you so much to everyone commenting and contributing to the conversation!  I have seen so many great ideas about how to use this to learn a language and how to watch movies with a newborn/any age child in the house!
LPT: Whenever you are having work done on the house, always insist on being told the supplier of all the materials/parts (windows, doors, blinds, tiles etc. etc.) - when you need spares 5 years down the line, there is no guarantee your contractor will still be around to tell you.*****I have rewritten the title to make it slightly clearer, since some people were having trouble with it (and my pride as a linguist can't take it):  **Whenever you have any work done on the house, always insist that the contractor tell you where all the materials and parts they have used were sourced from. If you ever need spare/replacement parts in the future, you might not be able to find out where to get them from because your contractor might not be around any more.**  I have followed my own advice sometimes (e.g. writing down paint colour codes) but I have a roller blind that has been broken for two years now because I can't find the place where the contractor got them from (they are unbranded) and he won't return my calls.
LPT Mamma animals often leave their babies for short periods to go and find food so don't immediately bring in a lonely baby animal.*****It's spring so it's baby season.  Most mamma animals find a spot they feel is safe and leave their babies while they get food, sometimes it's for hours.  Leave wild baby animals be, they are tougher than they look.  &#x200B;  Exceptions obviously apply.  If the babies are in danger, show signs of infection or injury, do try and get them help.  If they are in danger, see if you can move them to a safer spot (take a look online to get specific tips for that animal) before getting a rehabilitation center involved. 
LPT: Use cable binders in this specific way to organize multiple lose cables under your desk (picture in text).*****[Like so](https://i.imgur.com/SFR7puf.jpg)
LPT: Take time to learn how to properly fall. It sounds ridiculous but as a snowboarder/skateboarder if you know how to fall it will save you from injury very easily. Not just in extreme sports but in every day life.*****Edit: Wow I didn’t realize this had such an “impact” on so many people. (Please excuse my shit pun)   But for those of you wondering how to learn please take the advice of other redditors and take some martial art classes,  skate/snowboarding lessons and one major way I learned was air awareness lessons on trampolines.
LPT: When buying a duvet for your bed, buy one size larger (or more) than your current bed size. The extra duvet will provide greater comfort especially when sharing.*****
LPT: When resigning from a company, don't tell a single person until your management has acknowled and accepted it.*****As a manager who faces employee resignations, in many ways it can open a door to conversation. It's not always about money. Maybe it's an opportunity in another department, maybe it's a change in responsibility and yes, sometimes it's a pay change.  However, the moment you go running to your coworkers proudly telling them you've just given your notice, that opportunity is gone. Management generally doesn't need the appearance of weakness and counter offers are precisely that. If half the company knows and you ended up staying with the company, everyone knows what happened and it fosters bad behavior.  Also, accepting a counter offer is NOT the end of the world as many would have you believe. It's entirely situational and sometimes you have to play the game.    EDIT: Wow. Compensation is always a touchy subject. A few things to understand before you continue to assume that I am the world's worst manager.    1. Someone posted a good summary of how the annual review/raise process works.  We get a bucket of money to spread across a team as we see fit.  It's usually a small bucket.  I also never have the power to walk into HR and say "Hey, give this guy a 20% raise, he's earned it. Oh, and why not do the same for the rest of my team while you're at it?"  In fact, I have very little control and even a counter is just leverage for any manager to get traction on the subject.    2. Seems that the consensus is that every single person in the workforce outside of the fabled "top performer" is underpaid.  I can assure you that that isn't the case.  Many times people have that impression and they are actually perfectly within their pay bands.  Go ahead, tear me apart for this, it's just the truth...  3. Remember employment is a mutual agreement.  Everything is in play.  If you don't like what you do or what you get paid, talk with your feet.  There is nothing wrong with that.  
LPT: If you are heading to the beach this summer, become familiar with "riptides" and how they work. If you get caught in one swim parallel to the shore until you are out of it. Do not try to swim toward the force of the current toward the shore.*****
LPT: When you put in a fresh bin bag, sprinkle some cat litter into the bottom of the bag. It will absorb any gross liquids, and your bags will have almost no bad odour.*****1. Bin bag = trash bag/rubbish bag/garbage bag. 2. You don't HAVE to use cat litter. You can use shredded paper, baking soda, dryer sheets, whatever. 3. In my country we only have trash collection one day a week, so I can't change my bags every day. 4. Unscented cat litter is a thing. 5. The litter goes in the BAG guys
LPT: Repeat a desired habit immediately >10x to 'lock it in.'*****In Air Force basic training the training instructors would turn on the lights and we'd jump out of bed and make the bed in seconds. Then they'd tell us to get back into bed, turn off the lights, and do it again (good times).  After ten or twenty repetitions in a row, your body gets the idea.  I used this recently to teach myself to hang up my coat when I get in. Enter home, walk to closet, hang coat on hanger. Grab coat, walk back out of home. Repeat ten or so times and it replaces 'chuck your coat wherever' reflex.  Edit: wrong version of hanger. Not where we kept our airplanes.
LPT: If you live far away from a young family member you want to stay connected to, call them on a schedule. The time that passes in your busy life is a lot longer to them. What might seem like not so long to you, seems a lot longer to them.*****
LPT: When you're editing a paper, change the font to something unfamiliar. Then change the font size. When you're familiar with a piece, your eyes gulp whole passages and miss typos and other grammatical errors. New fonts focus your eyes on each word and letter.*****
LPT: Even if you're pretty sure a friend can't go to an event, invite them anyway.*****Your friend will greatly appreciate you thinking of them, and may also be able to clear their schedule to allow them to go.   This also prevents said friend from feeling left out, and they can't be angry for not being invited, should someone post things on social media or them just find out in general.   EDIT: /u/newsfan had a great point: It always feels better to turn down an invitation than to not be invited at all.   EDIT2: /u/TomilloT has a great point: an invitation could potentionally cause serious stress and anxiety in some people. When inviting anyone, especially when you know they can't go, always make sure they know there's no pressure to go.
LPT: When taking a road trip, it's a good idea to have about $20 in quarters in your glove compartment either for tolls or parking meters.*****Good for the laundromat too.
LPT: The first time you need a certified birth certificate for a child, order 5 copies instead of one. You’ll be glad you did over the next 18 years.*****
LPT: If you feel that a conflict is emerging, seize any opportunity to change the form of communication (e.g. switch from e-mail to a phone call)*****Many conflicts can be nipped in the bud by changing the form of communication. The most obvious example is switching from written communication to paying a visit (or calling on the phone), or the other way around: leaving a conversation that doesn't lead anywhere and instead write a text message or an e-mail where you explain your position.  1. The pause gives you (and the counterpart) a chance to calm down, in case either of you is worked up. 2. It might give you a new approach to whatever the difference of opinion is about, since the new form of communication demands that you rethink it. 3. When writing emails/texting, many people accidentally come across as either blunt or sarcastic (especially if there's a difference of opinion going on). If that's how you interpret the other person, speaking to them might dispel your concerns.  &#x200B;  EDIT: I want to point out that the LPT is for **keeping** a discussion, misunderstanding or difference of opinion **from turning into a conflict**.   For handling full on conflicts, where your primary concern is for instance keeping your job or preparing for a legal process, the LPT might not be ideal. Lots of people are pointing out the need to have an ongoing conflict on record, by e-mailing instead of calling. I'm not going to disagree.
LPT: When going to a casino everyone always sets a limit of how much they are willing to lose. But just as important, set a reasonable number that if you do win, that's when you walk away.*****
LPT: if you want to give something away online, still add a price. Even if it's very low for that item it will scare away 90% of those who will just relist the item immediately. Plus it'll pleasant surprise for someone when you give them it free.*****
LPT: If you get fully satisfied by an employee's service in retail, don't just thank them in person, , keep your receipt, ask for their name and then take the survey and mention their name in it. That way you ensure that their hard work reaches corporate.*****
LPT: One 18 inch pizza is more pizza than two 12 inch pizzas.*****Sometimes it's better value to order a large instead of two mediums.  LifePizzaTips
LPT: If you're someone who finds it hard to get started on a task, tell yourself you'll do it for 30 minutes only. You have given yourself permission to stop after 30 minutes, but the likelihood is you'll carry on.*****
LPT: There are still 10,000 puppy mills in the United States. If you're buying a dog, insist on seeing the breeder's facilities.*****EDIT: To sum up what I think were some great comments:   - There are many great dogs who need homes in shelters. Go follow your local humane society on Facebook.  - *NEVER* get a dog from a pet store.  - Apparently this LPT applies for other animals as well (e.g. Parrots)  And just to clarify, puppy mills and responsible breeders are very, very different. See this article for a great write-up: http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/the-dog-factory-inside-the-sickening-world-of-puppy-mills-w457673
LPT: This whole week in New York is a "code blue"weather emergency. This means that if you see a homeless person on the street seeking shelter, you can call 311, give a description of the person and the location, and an outreach team will be dispatched to assist.*****
LPT: If you want to post a photo that you're proud of, crop the photo a little bit. That way, if somebody else posts the photo as their own, you can prove that you are the actual photographer.*****Heard this advice somewhere online a while ago and as somebody who does a lot of photography it's one of the best pieces of advice I've heard.
LPT: replace your straight shower curtain rod with a curved one. instantly roomier, bougier shower experience.*****
LPT: before having a discussion or a debate, ask the other party why they think someone would adopt your position instead of theirs, e.g. "why do you think some people favor vaccinations?" You will quickly discover whether a debate is worth it.*****A lot of people in my inbox are missing the point. /u/GooseJaw summarized it best:  >OP is telling you how to know whether or not a person’s opinion is reasoned.  You can’t reason a person out of a position they didn’t reason themselves into.  The content of your 'opponent's' response is completely irrelevant. All that matters is that they have based their position on reason. Otherwise, a productive debate is unlikely.
LPT: Put a bucket in your shower to catch the water while the shower heats up.*****Living in Australia we are currently under a huge heatwave, a drought and water restrictions. You can get 3/4 of a bucket every shower.  Bonus points for filling up a bird bath, or animal feeder. The animals need the water too  Edit: because like a billion people ask why I would have a hot shower during a heatwave. I wake up in the coldest part of the morning, around 4am to 6am. For everyone else I guess its a comfort thing.  Also thanks for the support guys. Sharing all your tips and stuff is great
LPT: When you see someone being harassed in public, act like you know them and get them out of the situation.*****I took a course on civic courage (?) last week and we were taught to not approach the perpetrators when we see a dangerous situation in public -- that would not help the victim, and would just lead to us getting punched in the face too. Instead, we're supposed to reach out to the victim, address them by name and ask them to come with us. This gets them out of the situation without needlessly endangering you.  Example (we watched a video on this): Two drunk guys enter a subway car and start bullying a skinny young guy reading a book (taking the book away, not letting him get up). Another passenger goes over (but doesn't get too close) and says, "Hey, Peter, I haven't seen you in a while, why don't you sit with me? How's the girlfriend?"  The people doing the workshop were former policemen and say this works 9 out of 10 times.  If nothing else, call 911. Don't look away.  Edited to add: As I said in multiple comments below, while I did learn this in my civic courage workshop last Saturday, the post today on TwoXChromosomes gave me the idea to post this LPT. So you guys can stop linking to that post, suggesting I "got the LPT" from that post, implying I'm "riding the coattails" of that post etc. I just want to get the word out there about an unusual and effective way to defuse a situation.
LPT: "Nutritionists","Nutritional Therapists", "holistic nutritionist", or "Nutritional Coaches" don't require any formal certification, education or training to use those titles. "Dieticians" do require it. Be careful who you accept diet & nutrition advice from.*******EDIT**  Important note to this. Only Registered Dietitians or RDNs (registered Dietician Nutritionists) are technically certified to diagnose & treat food/nutrition related illnesses, diseases, & conditions such as eating disorders & deficiencies.   1) Some or most people might spell it Dietitian, not Dietician. Unsure if one is correct or if its just regional.   2) YMMV. Certain countries or states likely have different regulations on this. AFAIK in  most parts of the US and UK, Nutritionists *can* get some sort of certification and higher ed training, but its not generally required, and its not as regulated as a Dietitian or Registered Dietitian.  In almost all cases, anything like "Diet Coach" or "Nutrition Coach" or "Heath Coach" or "Nutritional Specialist" are bs terms. Main takeaway from this LPT is do your research on your own country or state's rules, and be careful who you trust.   3) I'm not intending to imply that there aren't any Nutritionists with 4 year degrees, graduate degrees, or proper training. Just saying rigorous education & certification is not always required, unlike Dietitian, which is a regulated & protected term almost universally. I'm sure there are some great, knowledgeable Nutritionists and Nutritional Therapists out there...and some terrible quack Dietitians. Again, do your research and be careful who you trust. 
LPT: Take photos of your parents and elderlies tv/electronic remotes. It will give you a quick reference to leading them through troubleshooting problems to them over the phone.*****
LPT: Confidently understanding and properly making known you don't know the answer to a question is leagues better than trying to meander your way into a fake answer or straight up lying.*****Edit: I also believe saying, "I'm not sure, but let me find the answer for you" is definitely a great way to explain that you don't know the answer in a professional/work environment.
LPT: When Arguing, Try Restating the Main Point's of the Other Person's Argument Back to Them and Have Them Do the Same with You*****Believe it or not, the vast majority of Arguments are based on miscommunication.    With arguments, there are often several things occurring simultaneously that result in conflict.  1) Not understand the other person's argument  2)  Feeling that the other person does not understand your argument  3) Convoluting and intertwining non-related issues into the argument  4)  Arguing about two different things all the while thinking you are both arguing about the same thing...  5) An unwavering belief that you are right and the other person is wrong and thus you don't need to listen to their argument  ...  Next time you are arguing with someone pause the argument and restate their argument back to them.    Something like, "Hold on, I want to make sure I understand what you are arguing. You are saying that XYZ is broken and the only way to fix XYZ is to get QRS to modify Y so that it will fit better into Z?"  Now this has several benefits.    --First and foremost it helps to identify exactly what the fuck the argument is even about.  This is huge because most arguments get so convoluted the people arguing don't even know what they are arguing about (and this goes double for emotional and relationship type arguments when the people have history together).    --Secondly,   this technique demonstrates you are making an attempt to understand them and this will have a calming effect  --Thirdly, it forces you out of the frame of mind that you are automatically right and enables you to actually "listen" and "hear" what they are saying.  --Fourth, it helps you step outside the argument, see both sides, be more objective and able to see more solutions.  You can also do the reverse.  Pause the argument and ask "Can you tell me what my argument is?  Can you explain the problem as I see it?  This forces them to pause and process what you are saying and it helps to break the momentum and out-of-control death spiral arguments tend to descend into.    And again, it helps to actually help define the EXACT problem...
LPT: The first thing you should print after purchasing a 3D printer is replacement parts for said printer*****That way if one piece breaks, you can easily swap it out without having to order a part. Most 3D printers have at least a half dozen parts built from 3D printed parts. Also, make sure that the first thing you print after replacing a part is another one of those parts.
LPT: Before bringing your vehicle in for basic maintenance, check YouTube and see if there's an instructional video available. Often the work is a lot quicker, easier, and cheaper than you'd think to do yourself. Plus, you'll build confidence in your skills and a respectable knowledgebase.*****
LPT: Quora blocking you from reading an answer because you aren't logged in? Add "?share=1" to the end of the URL.*****
LPT: When a stranger asks you to take a picture for them, take a few unannounced pics as they get ready to pose. Sometimes the candid pics come out best.*****
LPT: When taking a taxi ALWAYS get a receipt even if you don't need one. That way if you happen to accidentally leave a personal belonging behind you will have the company name and taxi number.*****
LPT: Put subtitles on when watching something with multiple friends, conversations won't disrupt the movie and you won't force everyone to sit silent for 2 hours.*****It's sort of a compromise if you're really serious about the movie, but this way you can actually have the experience be a social event, crack jokes, and ask questions.
LPT: Don't undervalue yourself when deciding whether or not to apply for a new job. It's up to the person doing the hiring to determine if you are what they're looking for, and the only way to guarantee that you won't get the job is if you don't apply for it.*****
LPT: Not 100% certain you're ready for the responsibility of adopting a pet? Try fostering first. It costs you nothing, and enriches the pets' lives even if you don't ultimately adopt.*****Many shelters have programs where individuals can foster a pet free of charge.  The shelters will pay for the pets' vet bills and food, and in exchange (a) the pet lives with you; and (b) you agree to bring the pet to adoption events so that others can consider providing the pet a forever home.  This allows you a "test run" to see if you're ready to adjust your lifestyle to the needs of pet ownership, without the worry associated with (a) the cost of pet ownership, or (b) the potentiality that you decide you're not ready for pet ownership.  Plus, regardless of whether you do choose to adopt, in the meantime you've provided a pet with a loving home while it awaits its forever home.  Everyone wins.
LPT: If you’re reading this; relax your jaw muscle. It’ll help you relax.*****
LPT: Someone who likes you will often automatically look at you when they laugh or find something funny.*****This was a LPT I read a long time ago and it has helped me in quite a few situations since, as someone who is really quite terrible at taking hints having this life pro tip really helped open my eyes up to someone I liked reciprocating those feelings.
LPT: when trying to focus on something (writing, revising, reading) listen to music with no words. This allows you to block out unwanted sound and having no lyrics can stop you from being distracted.*****Edit: Holy shit this blew up, thanks to all of you <3
LPT: If you have a dashcam and see something where you need to record a licence plate but you know your dashcam is too far away, read the licence plate aloud for your cam's audio to record it.*****
LPT: Stop comparing yourself to others. Instead, compare yourself to where you were 1-2 years ago. Whether it's fitness or finance, use that as motivation for your own goals.*****
LPT: Always be the person who tells someone they have something in their teeth, shoes untied, fly is down, etc*****I have done this my entire life and people are almost always extremely grateful. It can be a bit awkward but if someone walks into a meeting or starts a conversation with me and I notice something like that, I will immediately interrupt them to let them know.  **Edit:** Lets just pretend I said 'booger in the nose' instead of 'Shoe is untied.' Apparently there are a lot of people who have frequently untied shoes that are very sensitive. I'm a 'tie it once and stuff your foot in it every morning' kind of guy.
LPT: If you find someone's identification card you can simply place it in your mail box and the post office will make sure it is returned. Free of charge no envelope just put it in mailbox! (I know this is the case for the U.S. not sure about elsewhere.)*****Edit:  Just to be clear. This is in regard to MOTOR VEHICLE LICENSES or STATE/GOV ISSUED I.D. THAT HAS YOUR ADRESS WRITTEN ON IT!  Edit: Wow! Did not expect this post to get nearly as much attention as it did! But Im thrilled so many people found this useful! Thank you!!!!!!!   Edit: I just want to give a bigg thanks to the Reddit community for making this a front page post that's got more than 25k updoots! Thank you guys. I can now die a happy soul. :)  
LPT: Don't buy lilies if you have a cat*****My significant other gave me some flowers for Valentine's Day. Turns out there were lilies in the bouqet and my cat ate some of the leaves. We had to rush my cat to the emergency vet, where he will be hooked up to an IV for 3 days. The bill is over $1000. It's unknown if he will survive and the vet told me that it's very serious. On the offchance that he does survive, there will likely be permanent kidney damage. My cat has been by my side since I was a kid and I can't imagine losing my little buddy.  Since today is Valentine's Day, and Easter is coming up soon... Please be aware that **LILIES ARE POISONOUS TO CATS**. Even just breathing in the pollen can result in death.  "The entire lily plant is toxic: the stem, leaves, flowers, pollen, and even the water in a vase. Eating just a small amount of a leaf or flower petal, licking a few pollen grains off its fur while grooming, or drinking the water from the vase can cause your cat to develop fatal kidney failure in less than 3 days. The toxin, which only affects cats, has not been identified. Dogs that eat lilies may have minor stomach upset but they don’t develop kidney failure."  **Here are the most toxic variety of lilies:** - Asiatic lily (including hybrids) - Daylily - Easter lily - Japanese Show lily - Oriental lily - Rubrum lily - Stargazer lily - Wood lily  [And here's a photo for reference.](https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/8a6b78ba-8e4e-4fc0-94db-f89344979618/svn/van-zyverden-flower-bulbs-83473-64_1000.jpg) Thank you for all of the kind wishes! I don't usually bring plants into the house, but these were a surprise gift and I was distracted by the holiday. Be safe everyone :(  **Update:** Max's chance of survival is looking pretty good, but he may need a few more days of treatment. He's been given charcoal and fluids, his kidney values are not normal but they're not alarming at the moment. I am overwhelmed by the amount of supportive comments and I'm so glad my post was able to help some kitties.  **Update #2:** Thank you so much to those who have donated, my SO and I are crying happy tears of relief. We reached our fundraising goal and now we can afford to give Max the additional treatment he needs. We're two broke college kids and your kindness means everything to us. I'll post another update with photos as soon as I can. Fingers crossed for a full recovery! I love you, internet strangers.
LPT: Taking pictures with your phone at a large event? Turn off your flash! Your flash is only good up to 12 feet, the stage lights are a thousand times brighter and you are just draining your battery. No flash = better pictures!*****
LPT: Daily use of the art of UPOD (under-promising, over-delivering) will help your life. Tell your S.O. that you will be home at 6pm and you are home at 6:30pm, doghouse. Tell them you will be home at 7pm and arrive at 6:30, hero. 50% of successful relationships are about managing expectations.*****Under-promise, over-deliver (UPOD).  Not new advice, I know, but there are some very specific caveats to be successful at this.    These are specifics that have helped me in my parenting of my 4 children, my successful career in the pursuit of an M.D. Ph.D. in Neuroscience/Neurology, my marriage of almost 12 years, and even my self-confidence (yes, I under promise and over deliver in my personal expectations).    1.) Realize that under-promising and over-delivering **is not an attempt to be dishonest, it can actually be more honest**, giving you a buffer in case weird stuff comes up (traffic, health issues, the other obligation you hadn't originally factored in). People often tell if you are just lying to them to impress them.   2.) UPOD only works in relationships in the long term if **the under-promise is still relatively close to what your gut estimate would have been in the first place**.  You shouldn’t tell your SO that you will be home at 10pm every evening, and show up at 6:30pm every day, as 6:30pm will be the new expectation regardless of what you say, and what you say will lose credibility.  3.)  **Don't over-promise to try to initially impress someone**, it will hurt you in the end.  If you are like me, you want others to think highly of you, which might tempt you to "offer" to do something quicker or much better than you probably can't do (or only can do under ideal circumstances).  This is especially true for people in new jobs and new relationships.  Although this might work out for you initially (you work crazy hours to meet a crazy deadline that you set for yourself to impress someone), it comes with some natural consequences that are nobody’s fault but your own.  First of all, you have now set the bar very high for yourself, making it difficult to over UPOD with them again.  Many will, going forward, expect you to maintain that expectation of you going forward.  Second, even if you somehow manage to keep it up, you will eventually OPUD (Over promise and under deliver), which can really hurt you in the end.  You might also come to resent the other person because of their expectations of you (even though in truth, you were the one that initially seeded those expectations in the first place).    4.) When starting out, **Buffer UPOD with "I wish" statements**.  I have 4 kids, and with my M.D. Ph.D. training, I literally cannot make it to all of my children's extracurricular events.  At the beginning of each school year, I remind my kids that although I wish I could make it to every event, I will not be able to attend everything. Every time I show up, my kids are totally stoked.  I sometimes wait until just a few hours before to let my kids know I can make it to an event (even though my wife has a much more advanced heads up) just to manage expectations.  Although some might say that this makes it hard for my kids to feel that they can rely on me, or trust me, I have found quite the opposite.  I have an almost 100% success rate at being to the things that I say I will be at.   5.) When employing UPOD, **Focus conversations on what you know 100% that you can do.**  For instance, when a colleague is really trying to pressure you to attend a conference that you probably don't have time to attend, reply with "I really wish I could go, but I probably can't.  Could you do me a favor when you get back and do lunch with me to discuss the interesting tidbits you learned/shared at the conference?"   When a customer at your restaurant asks you to make a specialty order that you are not sure the chef can do, let them know “I will check with the Chef to see if I can do this for you, but it is unlikely that we can do this.  However, I can bring you some free extra breadsticks that I can see you have all enjoyed so much this evening.”     6.)  **You can maintain an optimistic attitude while still UPOD-ing to yourself**.  I just realized that UPOD-ing yourself sounds really weird, but my point is that it helps to have realistic expectations of yourself, and to give yourself some buffer.  I used to always tell myself that I would get more work/homework done over Christmas vacation.  Turns out, I was always disappointed at how much I actually got done.  Now, before the break, I tell myself I will be happy to get 10 or so hours’ worth of work done each vacation period. If I get more done, I am pretty proud of myself.   For instance, even though I spent about an hour putting this post together, I am only really expecting it to be looked at by about 20 people, with only about 5 or 6 reading all the way to this point.  This is okay to me as if it helps even one or two people enjoy the success I have, it is worth it (also, I plan on sharing some of this directly with my close friends and family).     7.) **Under-expect in your own relationships with others**, and give people a break.  Realize that thing come up, and that everyone is fighting a hard battle.  Teach them, in gentle ways, how to UPOD.   8.) **In some instances, it is okay to let them know that you are UPOD-ing**.  Example, tell your friends that you would love to play games with them online this evening, but you are pretty sure that your boss is likely going to keep you after work (because he usually does on a Friday evening).  I say “some instances” because excessive explanations might actually get them to distrust you, especially if the explanations are beyond their current level of comprehension.  For example, for some, when a mechanic or doctor starts using words that no one has ever heard of, people become suspicious or resentful of that person.  For instance, you don’t need to explain why the pizza might be an extra 5 minutes later, just quote them 5-minutes later and wow them when you get there 10 minutes early.    I apologize if this felt like a lecture, I just would have loved if a parent or mentor had shared these with me before I had to learn many of these caveats the hard way.    Thanks for those of you that made it through all of this, I am excited to hear from you about what you have learned about the art of UPOD.  Tl;DR:  Under-promising and over-delivering has helped my life, and will help your life, but there is an art to it.  Edit: Formatting.   Edit:  Thanks for my first Reddit Gold!!!   Edit:  The driving example was  probably a terrible one, just the first one that came to my mind.  My wife is a very patient person, this was just the first example that came to my mind (my wife usually just wants to know when I am home and if they should start dinner with me wait a bit).  She is my rock.  I have also supported her in her career goals and am supporting her through school right now as well!  I am very thankful when she UPOD to me as well.   Edit:  For those wondering, I have finished my Ph.D. and have a few years left of medical training.  Thanks for the well wishes.  Edit:  I normally have terrible grammar (just check out my other posts if you want to cringe).  Thanks for the tips on correcting it.  
LPT: If you make a packing list before you go on a trip, review and edit the list when you return from your trip then save it. Over time, you'll be able to pack more efficiently.*****I've been doing this with business trips and vacations for a couple of years.  I now have a few different packing lists that I can pull up whenever needed.  Saves me time and space when packing.
LPT: If you're already having a terrible day, do as many things that you've been dreading that you can.*****At a certain level of bad day, you're unlikely to feel much worse. After you complete your tasks, you'll feel better, or you'll at least keep those things from ruining another day. 
LPT : Before posting online a photo you took, crop some small part of it out first - that way you can always prove it's yours.*****
LPT: If you're a student planning on your career, look up postings of your dream job, find the skills and qualifications you'll need, then work backwards from there.*****Doing this will not only give you an idea of the skills you need and which courses to take, but makes you reflect if the job description sounds like something you'd want to do everyday in the future.  Edit: thanks for the support, differing (but equally helpful) opinions, and the gold
LPT: If you're trying to cut back on drinking, and you're like me and buy alcohol when getting groceries, start shopping in the morning. Unless you drink in the morning or early day, you won't feel the urge nearly as bad to get a case of beer or wine.*****
LPT: If you're thinking about getting a tattoo, get it done in Henna first: It will force you to live with the design and location past the honeymoon stage and show you how comfortable you are with it in your day to day life.*****
LPT: If someone calls you to upgrade your home security system, don't tell them you don't have one. Say your system works fine and you're not interested in upgrading. You never know if you're talking to a real company or a possible burglar.*****I get a lot of spam calls at work for people selling home security, and usually I tell them "this is a business" and they get embarrassed and hang up. But today someone called with the same spiel but then tried to then pivot to talking about business security instead. Pretty obviously someone trying to set-up a scam. Remember just because they're on the phone and sound like they could be miles away, don't take it for granted.  EDIT: Whoa just woke up to over 100 notifications and my most upvotes ever! I will do my best to keep up but it looks like this has taken on a life of its own, which is hopefully a good thing!  EDIT 2: Yea the obvious thing is to not answer numbers you don't know or to hang up immediately. The point is if you find yourself in this situation, answering safely won't be your first instinct. Maybe now it will be.  EDIT 3: For anyone wondering, the responses largely breakdown into a few categories:  1. Don't answer the phone/just hang up. 2. I don't need security I have guns/dogs. 3. Tell them to come so you can use your security/guns/dogs. 4. Yes this actually happened to me/someone I know/this is useful. 5. This would never happen/is not useful.  It's that 4th category that makes it all worth it! I appreciate your stories. Not trying to paranoid, just trying to help :)

LPT: Spraying some Pam onto your snow shovel will make the snow slide right off when you shovel.*****
LPT: If you've had the same internet service plan for a while, take a look at what your ISP's current advertised plans are. You may be "grandfathered in" on a slower, more expensive plan.*****Realized this the other day, and I wish I had figured it out years ago. My family has been on the same internet + phone + cable package from Knology (now WOW) for over a decade. After fees and taxes, my dad was paying $270/mo for the whole package, and though I don't know the cable/phone details, I do know we were only getting 20 Mbps down/2 Mbps up internet speed. That didn't seem right to me, so I went and took alook.  On their website, this ISP does not seem to offer any plan that has 20 down/2 up internet speed. They do have a 10d/1u single-user service (standalone internet), but in their package deals, they only had 50, 100, 500, and 1000 internet speeds (no 20).  Turns out, we've been paying for the same service *at the same rate* for the past 15+ years. So while high-speed internet was getting faster and the cost was going down, we were still paying what was considered a fair price for what was considered a high speed in the early 2000s.  One call to the ISP, our plan was changed over the phone and a tech came out today and installed the new modem. We are now getting 1Gbps ~~up~~ down, 50 Mbps ~~down~~ up, have the same phone and cable service as before, and are paying $30 a month **less** than before.  Edit: For like the 50th time, I typed down when I meant to type up, and up when I meant to type down. My speed is 1G down, 50M up, not the other way around.  Also, as people have mentioned in the comments, **this doesn't apply to every ISP** and in fact some ISPs will do the opposite: they will actually prohibit you from upgrading your plan if you're a longtime user, as their good deals are only for new customers. WOW seems to be pretty decent as far as customer service goes, but I can't speak for any other ISP.
LPT: Before you stick your credit card in any reader, see if you can pull the reader off the machine. Card scanners are showing up everywhere, make a habit of checking every time.*****
LPT - If you are keeping a family memento or heirloom keep a card or note with the item that explains the significance or backstory. It will help your descendants differentiate between items you valued vs. those you just pack-ratted.*****
LPT: Always say goodnight to your SO, even if you're upset with them.*****Taught to me by my parents, I do this in my relationship. Telling your SO goodnight especially after a fight tells them that you value your relationship more than you are upset about whatever thing is making you upset.  Edit: Holy moly, guacamole. I did not expect this LPT to take off so much. I got a bunch of great responses, both positive and critical, and I like both because it means that this LPT made people really buckle down and think about their relationships and how they handle them.   This LPT made it to the front page of Reddit, which is hella exciting! Anyway, thank you to all who took part in the discussion!
LPT: Whenever you have to watch/ take notes on a video for school always write down the point in time in the video. It makes it much easier to go back later and get the full quote or idea.*****
LPT: If you're ever called by your bank's fraud department hang up and call them back.*****I got a call from someone claiming to be from fraud department of my bank over the weekend. The call showed up on my caller ID as US Bank which is how I have it saved in my contacts. He said there was a fraudulent charge from American Airlines and I was on that their website booking a flight about an hour prior to the call.  For a moment I thought it was legit but then he asked for a pin #.  Just be careful because the caller ID makes it seem real. The actual fraud department said they have seen this multiple times with the caller ID showing as the bank. :/  edit... Hey thanks to everyone that shared a story or gave advice! I appreciate everyone's input :)
LPT: Put a peeled banana in the freezer for a snack that almost has the same texture and taste of ice cream but without the guilt or calories.*****I should *have* said 'but with less guilt or calories' as opposed to "without the guilt or calories". But never mind. Still though it was a great snack to have during an unbearably hot August this year.  Happy to see quite a few other people agree or will try it out 
LPT: A goal towards a tidier home is not through periodic 'binge cleaning' but by keeping the house clean through small, everyday tasks.*****To have a tidy, livable house that is always ready for unexpected visitors, you should focus on small tasks that keep your house clean everyday.  For example: If you pick up a book or a magazine up or play a board game, put it back after use.  If you use a blanket, fold it up after you get up. Anything that is displaced when in use - even a pencil or a remote.  Instead of piling dishes in the sink, try to wash your cup or plate immediately after you use it. This will leave the sink free and you will only need to wash the larger cooking dishes after you're done cooking.  [EXTRA PROTIP: if you have something on the kitchen counter, put it where it belongs (even in the sink) so that your counter is always clear. Even if your sink is piled up with large dishes but you have clean counters, it's still a better look than a tidy sink surrounded by dirty counters.]  What this leaves is a tidier, clutter free home which will only require mostly vaccuming, dusting, and/or mopping. When unexpected visitors arrive, you don't have to scramble.  I never have to do much in my room. My closet is a bit tougher to maintain but the rest of the things are always tidy and in their place. I have siblings who keep their rooms messy and then they binge clean later. It works for them but I don't think thats an efficient method.  Of course its harder when there are more people in the house, but if you encourage as many people as you can then the clutter will reduce.  EDIT: Massive response, thanks! The point is to do small tasks everyday so that it 1) doesn't buildup 2) helps you maintain a habit of cleanliness where you naturally clean something the moment you see it 3) makes your home's default setting as 'clean' :)   Also, if your house is massively cluttered, then it's a good idea to do a binge clean first and then maintain it by doing small chores everyday. It's said that if you do something for long enough, say 40 days, it becomes a habit.  EDIT 2: When you rely on binge cleaning, your mindset is that you don't want to do it now because you can do it later. This makes you less likely to clean as you go. Whats the point when you can do it later? So the best way is to binge clean once and maintain it by cleaning after yourself. Also i missed a word in the title, sorry!   
LPT: When starting a new job, make the commute a few days before you actually start to see what traffic is like heading there that time of the day. Don’t be that person showing up late on your first day cause of traffic!*****
LPT: Just because you can get training or a degree in a field doesn't mean you can get a job doing it. Research your interests before committing to an expensive degree path*****You can look to teachers and professors for advice, and to find contacts in your desired field to ask about employment prospects before you go into debt for an expensive degree. 
LPT: Place the back of your hand on the pavement. If you can't hold it there for more than 5 seconds. It's too hot to walk your dog.*****

LPT: If you can see ordinary household lights through your eclipse glasses or handheld viewer, it's no good.*****
LPT: Dont worry about something embarresing you said or did in the past. Nobody thinks about it as much as you do until you mention it.*****
LPT: If you're making a salad for yourself, put the harder toppings on bottom. It's not much for presentation, but it's easier to stab through lettuce into a crouton than through a crouton into lettuce.*****
LPT: If you think you have an Alcohol Addiction, you probably do. The best thing you can do is get it early before you start getting withdrawals. Go to rehab, meetings, detox, or talk to someone.*****Edit: It means so much to me knowing that this post is touching people in ways I would of never thought. Another thing is Alcohol Withdrawal, along with Benzodiazepine withdrawal are the two most DANGEROUS withdrawals that you can have. In most cases a medically supervised detox is VERY necessary. You can have seizures from these withdrawals and they can kill you. I had a seizure last February when I quit for good. I was thickheaded and stubborn and thought I could do it on my own. Luckily my parents were at my house and called an ambulance and from there I went to a medically assisted detox and then Rehab for 14 days. I joined the gym and went to meetings as soon as I got out of the Rehab.
LPT: To avoid the fake, cheesy smile on young kids when you try to take their picture, ask them to tell you a joke while you take it, but tell them that they should absolutely not laugh while telling it. Beautiful pictures every time of glee.*****
LPT: If you are frying a turkey this week - turn off the propane at the tank before dropping the bird in the oil, then re-light your flame after the bird is in to prevent flash splash over fires.*****Be safe.  Happy Thanksgiving week fellow Americans.  Canada...no fair you got a head start.  To the rest of the world - I hope you have a fantastic week!
LPT: If you want to make sure someone has learned the correct process, make them deliberately do everything as wrong as possible*****Speaking as a teacher (and anyone in an educational or supervisory role will likely relate), one of the most frustrating things is when you explain a task to someone and check that they understand, only for them to completely botch it. In fairness, we often do make assumptions that because *we* can do it well, others will have the intuition to also have the same skill and knowledge. It's difficult for a learner to recognise and validate their own process as being correct. However, people are very good at recognising when something is wrong.  The way this concept was introduced to me was to play two games of tic-tac-toe. The first game: play as normal and see who wins. You normally see some cockiness as people try to outplay each other and reach the inevitable draw. There's no real thought process of how to win, just making sure the other person doesn't.  Second game: the goal was to *intentionally lose*. Suddenly, the room fell quiet. Each player had to think about doing the *wrong* move in order to lose. There was much more reflection and processing than playing to win.  This was then explained in the context of doing PowerPoint presentations. We have an idea of what a good presentation should look like (clear bullet points, minimal text, minimal distractions, etc.), but we never seem to get students to understand what we expect. Turn the expectations around: as a pre-task, get them to make the *worst possible presentation*, and you suddenly get a bunch of people engaged in outdoing each other in throwing in walls of text, spinny animations and multiple soundtracks. When the students made their proper presentations, they avoided all the things that they had deliberately done wrong.  Whether you're teaching someone else, or teaching yourself, it may be helpful to do it wrong.  **Obligatory clarification edits:**  1. This is intended to be a one-off exercise to **check** understanding. Don't deliberately teach people the wrong method to do this. 2. The key is that the learner is **intentionally** making the wrong move, not accidentally or unknowingly. They must be aware that it is wrong. 3. Don't do this in a real, practical situation. This is a learning and training tip.
LPT: in every new city you visit, allow yourself a $20 “idiot fee” before you get upset over any wasted/lost money*****I’ve been traveling around for a few months solo and little things just happen. You enter the subway on the wrong platform and have to buy another ticket, you missed the train that you were supposed to get because you got lost, late fees, I’ve gotten ripped off by several street vendors etc. Just remind yourself that it all goes to your allotted $20 idiot fee because you’re new here and it happens and you won’t make the mistake twice. I’ll only start to get hard on myself once my little mistakes cost me more than that $20 and it’s greatly improved my attitude with these small annoyances.  Adjust the number to whatever fits your lifestyle!  Edit: holy crap this exploded, thanks for sharing all of your silly stories guys! And to anyone leaving something negative it’s not about being able to afford the $20 it’s about keeping up the positive energy and going with the flow in little stressful hiccups, don’t be too hard on yourself and the universe will pay you back later :)
LPT: If you're a manager or supervisor remember every once in a while to ask your employees what the hardest part of their job is.*****Their answers might surprise you and can often times be easily remedied.
LPT: New college freshmen, get to know your professors early on. In your later years, good relationships with professors can lead to recommendations, research, and job opportunities.*****
LPT: If you find yourself procrastinating in starting a new task, tell yourself you just taking some practical steps now to "prepare" to do it later. You might end up getting half the job done or more just in the process of "preparing."*****
LPT: If you forget people's names almost immediately after they introduce themselves, repeat back their name when you shake hands*****"Hi, I'm Sam"  "Hi Sam, I'm Jo, nice to meet you"  Repeating their name and looking at their face will help lodge it in your memory.
LPT: A statement made by someone you perceive to be smarter than you does not automatically make their statement true. Always fact check those statements that might change the way you perceive your world view.*****
LPT: When teaching someone something, don't preface it with "It's easy". If they struggle when learning, they will be more easily discouraged and frustrated because they failed at something you said would be "easy". Each person learns differently, so "easy" is relative.*****
LPT: After you assemble furniture, use duct tape to attach things like hex keys, that came with the furniture, to the underside. You won't have to look for it when you have to disassemble the furniture.*****EDIT: did not expect this post to hit the front page.   To those saying keep a tool box, I get it. You and thousand other people have already said that. If you have a well organized toolbox, good for you. This tip wasn't meant for you.  To the people who say don't use duck/duct tape, fair point. You can use whatever tape works for you. The concept is same.  Thanks for the gold, kind stranger. 
LPT: When reading a company's Glassdoor pay attention to the date of the review. If you notice a lot of good reviews in a short time frame then that means that HR sent out a bulletin for employees to write reviews for the company.*****My company's HR recently sent out a memo to all employees and left up many flyers to tell us to review our company on Glassdoor. This is allowed by Glassdoor and a tactic they advocate for companies wishing to combat their negative reviews or low rating. Though the memo/flyer say to leave "honest" reviews theres an implication that they want us to leave good/positive reviews.  When I had initially started working for my company the rating was in the low 3's and the reviews were pretty sporadic in terms of the date. After the memo I saw a huge amount of positive reviews in a short time frame and their rating went up to 4.6. This overshadowed the negative reviews which I found to be accurate.  edit: Some have asked what does it mean if there are a lot of bad reviews in a short time frame. That usually means that theres been a layoff or a [negative] restructure in management.
LPT: When using Pandora, never use thumbs up, only thumbs down. This will keep the station constantly looking for something you like, while avoiding things you don't like. It also keeps it from playing the same 10 songs over and over.*****Unless a "playlist" is what you're actually going for, but we all know that's why we have Spotify.  Edit: sorry. 
LPT: Folks with vaginas/periods, if you ever bleed through your clothes, drench the area with diluted hydrogen peroxide. It will fizz up for around 30 seconds, becoming foam like, and when you wipe it away there will be no more blood in the clothes and they also won't be stripped of color.*****
LPT: If you measure every purchase in hours you worked instead of price, you'd be less of a consumer.*****Edit: So the general consensus has been that this applies more to poorer people--and I agree with that. A lot of people have replied with that already!
LPT If you’re heading to a busy cafe or restaurant that doesn’t take bookings arrange meet your friends at 10 minutes to the hour (9:50am or 6:50pm) instead of on the hour. You’ll beat out everyone who arranged to meet on the hour and get seated much sooner.*****EDIT: A lot of people in this thread seem to have an issue with punctuality. Being on time is a show of respect for the people you’re meeting with. It tells them that you respect their time enough to arrive on time and not leave them waiting. I don’t really understand the problem - plan ahead, account for traffic, leave time for parking and walking to the venue... what am I missing??
LPT: The loud ads at the gas pump can usually be muted by pressing one of the unlabeled buttons next to the screen.*****
LPT: If you have children and talk to them about danger (which you should), tell them that if someone is ever attempting to take them they should yell “you’re not my mom/dad!” That way, passers-by know it’s not just a kid having a tantrum.*****
LPT "zippo fluid" costs $7 an oz, but if you call it what it really is "naphtha" you can find it for $11 a gallon. What other products increase prices by repackaging?*****i meant 7$ for 12 oz. or a tenth of a gallon.
LPT: Most people at the gym are to busy with themselves to pay attention to you or anyone else, so don't sweat it*****
LPT: Keep life at work professional. If people start gossip don’t involve yourself. If managers ask you questions come up with positive ways to talk about people. Use neutral words instead of disagreeing. Work hard, then enjoy your separate life outside of work.*****
LPT: If you are having trouble with your phone charger, use a toothpick to clean out the phones charging port. More often than not, it’s filled with lint from being in your pocket. Pull it out and it will work like new again.*****
LPT: If you are quitting a vice (smoking, drinking, etc.) treat yourself with the money you are saving. It makes quitting easier.*****
LPT: Increase your offers to help a friend who is mourning about 6 weeks after the death of their loved one. This is the point at which the initial wave of support has died off and people are particularly vulnerable.*****A wise leader of a church taught me this.  He had helped many through the grieving process. When a close friend of mine lost a loved one tragically, I asked him what I should do to help them.  He taught me that often, the hardest time for people while grieving was when the initial wave of condolences had gone away and people don't really know/forget to offer help anymore.  Meanwhile, the person grieving has to start trying to transition back to "normal life" and routines and they are often left more lonely than ever. **(Note , I have noticed that this jump in time to support can be much sooner that six weeks, sometimes it is a soon as a few day).   To be clear, offering to help initially is great and important as well but consistent continued support is priceless.   Edit:  I wish I could **hug** all of you through the screen.  So many of you have shared your advice about your personal struggles with loved ones.... Thank-you.      Also, some subreddits that may help you that were pointed out in the comments include r/grief , r/SuicideBereavement , r/Grieving , and r/babyloss . 
LPT When online shopping, If you have a choice between a free shipping discount or an item discount of roughly the same amount, Use free shipping to get all your money back if you return*****
LPT: Trying to break your smartphone addiction? Turn your phone to “grayscale” mode. The lack of color will make your phone screen less appealing and notification symbols less urgent.*****
LPT: Use the FORD method when you don’t know what to say in conversation*****F - Family (Their S/O, kids, siblings, pets, family traditions)  O - Occupation (What do they do? How did they get into it? Where did they go to school?)  R - Recreation (What do they like to do?)  D - Dreams (Ask about their goals, dreams, and aspirations)    
LPT If you accidentally type something in all caps, highlight it and hit Shift+F3*****The same also works if you need to change lowercase to caps.  Edit: As some people below have pointed out, this is indeed a ~~Windows~~ Microsoft Office feature. Personally I have used this on Microsoft Word and Outlook. Sorry for not being clearer, I don't use other operating systems very much, so don't get the chance to test these sort of things!
LPT: When sitting down while talking to someone, cross your legs. If you need to leave or want to get out of the conversation, uncross them and lean forward slightly. The person you're talking to will likely start to wrap up what they're saying.*****This probably works because of the sudden loss of a casual demeanor. The person will see it as a signal that you're about to leave, and will likely end the conversation for you, usually within mere moments.  Edit: I just woke up, and can't believe how much attention it got! I posted this because I used to find goodbyes awkward, but when I started doing this it much got easier. As others have mentioned, leaning forward might indicate interest in the conversation. What I meant to say is that you should stop leaning backward. I guess I phrased it poorly. 
LPT: If you haven't used your voice in a while (sleeping, lonely, etc) and suddenly need to take a phone call, hum for a few seconds prior. Your vocal cords won't let you down.*****
LPT: Instead of saying "I don't know" when your boss asks you a question say "I'll find out." It'll make them respect you more.*****
LPT: Take photographs of your expensive belongings and their serial numbers and store them in a safe place. If the item(s) were to ever be stolen, you can provide a photograph and serial number to the Police to strengthen your chances of retrieval.*****I transfer my photographs to a flash drive and store it in my safe. Some say to store them on your laptop or computer, but you’ll regret it when the laptop or computer gets stolen also.
LPT: When you write, always vary your sentence length. Why? It makes your writing more compelling. "Write music," Gary Provost said.*****Source:  https://i.imgur.com/GMyxkJV.png
LPT: Avoid using analogies in heated arguments. They are only effective when the other person is willing to learn. Otherwise, your opponent will just nitpick your example and you won't get through to them.*****Edit: Obviously it's best to avoid heated discussions and attempt a civil conversation, but this is not always possible. I tend to see people try to convince others of something by using an analogy and I've learned from experience that this rarely works.
LPT : IF you find yourself in a bit of a slump, pay yourself a bit of extra attention. Get a haircut, buy some new clothes. Just that can really help give your confidence a needed boost.*****Edit : Wow, this got huge! Thanks for all the upvotes and comments. There is some really positive and motivating advice to be read amongst the comments, great stuff.  A lot of people have mentioned money as a limiting factor and that's a good point for the particular example I provided in the op, but the general gist of what I'm saying is that when you least feel like getting up, getting dressed and getting out, is when it'll probably do you the most good.  I wish everyone all the best with their own individual struggles and please seek professional advice if things are really bad. 
LPT: Before you buy a house get an insurance quote; it'll tell you crime rates, flood/fire risk, type of neighborhood claims and more******edit* : *i posted this because of a incident which i faced recently in my country. i am not sure if this statement valid in uk or us just wanted to share this before someone do a mistake like i did.* 
LPT: When writing a thesis or a scientific paper, don't end your day with a completed section. Write at least one or two sentences into the next topic to make it easier for your future self to continue writing the next day.*****As a lazy person, I have big trouble starting to write. When I am in, it helps me a lot to think through my next logical steps and write a few sentences into that direction so I can continue seamlessly the next day..  Also sorry if that was bad english (I am not studying english :D) 
LPT: If you are denied boarding or if your flight is cancelled or delayed for at least two hours, ask at the check-in counter or boarding gate for the text stating your rights, particularly with regard to compensation and assistance to claim proper compensation.*****
LPT: When buying a car, set a reminder for a little while before the warranty expires. Then have a trusted mechanic inspect it carefully at that time so you can go to the dealer and have any lurking mechanical problems fixed before you stop being covered.*****Little things like corroded battery terminals can often go unnoticed until they cause worse problems. You want to get those fixed under warranty if you can or else you'll have to pay much more expensive repairs yourself later.  edit: "trusted mechanic" can include your dealer themselves  edit 2: RIP inbox, it's been real, turning off notifications for this post, thanks for popping my r/all cherry
LPT: When you break a glass on a hard floor, shine a flashlight parallel to the floor so you can see the shadows of tiny pieces you would otherwise miss.*****
LPT: Take a selfie when you have a good hair-day. Show it to your hairdresser next time. They'll know what you want, and it's a realistic, achievable style.*****
LPT: (online shopping) When you next see a discount code online e.g. "use CODE10 for 10% off" - there is absolutely no harm in trying CODE20 first.*****In many cases there are codes that are valid all year round but they only get advertised at certain times.   Heck! Whenever you're at the online checkout and you see the option to apply a discount code, try a generic one like "TWITTER10" or "BRAND10".  (Source: I am a digital marketer that sets these codes up and am also lazy.)  EDIT: A popular comment is that there is a browser extension called Honey that does this for you.
LPT: If you are making a word document with lots of pictures in it, first insert a 1x1 table and then the picture in it. The weird things that happen with pictures in word won't happen. A bit of an extra work but it makes formatting the document that much easier.*****Edit: thanks for the gold kind soul.
LPT: Put frozen berries in your oatmeal as soon as it's done cooking*****By the time it is cool enough to eat, the berries will be the same temperature as the oatmeal! Also, frozen berries are cheaper than fresh, can be purchased in bulk, and last longer.  EDIT: Grammars
LPT: If you have kids who are still enjoying dressing up, the next few days are your best friend. Halloween costumes will go on sale everywhere for a fraction of their original price.*****
LPT: If someone you care about is in need, say "Tell me what you need." Not "Let me know if you need anything". Being direct makes it easier for them to ask, instead of just being a generic and pretty meaningless gesture.*****
LPT Before buying a memory foam mattress, do some research on memory foam manufacturers. Many will custom build you a mattress for a fraction of the cost, with literally the same materials.*****EDIT: Since everyone keeps asking, start here: https://www.thomasnet.com/products/viscoelastic-foam-30688758-1.html Do your homework and make a few calls.  If you’re willing to make a few calls, you can get a chunk of premium memory foam for cheaper than a conventional spring mattress. These are the same people that produce materials for the major brands. It usually would not break any rules, and would make them more money, to cut out the middle man.
LPT: With new privacy regulations coming soon and most companies updating their Terms of Service (ToS), you should know about https://tosdr.org/ "Terms of service; didn't read"--a website providing a short version of many terms of service.*****
LPT: When camping, always inspect the trees for dead limbs or tops prior to setting up your tent or hammock. These dead trees are known as widowmakers or fool killers.*****
LPT: If you have to pay a company to work for them, it's a scam. Walk away.*****
LPT: If you have a friend or family member that is job hunting, do not keep asking them if they have found a job yet. They will let you know if they have found one.*****Job hunting is often stressful and can decrease someone’s self-esteem if they keep getting rejected. Just be there for them and be supportive of the process.  Edit: Wow!! This post went significantly better than expected. Thank you everyone for the comments and the good discussion. I’m glad this has been something helpful.  2nd Edit: Also, thank you good people for the platinum, gold and silver!
LPT: After assembling IKEA furniture, tape the key to the underside so that you can easily find it in the future, if you need to tighten screws or disassemble it.*****My desktop chair's armrest was coming loose, so I looked under it to find out which screw needed to be tightened. The original key that I had used to assemble the chair was taped to the underside, making it quick and easy for me to tighten the screw.  Funniest thing was that I had completely forgotten that I had done it, and was stunned at how smart of a trick it was  EDIT: Yeah I have a toolbox.... This trick made it so I didn't have to go find my allen-keys and I could just fix the armrest right then and there. 
LPT: When drying clothes in the sun, turn them inside out so the colours don’t fade in the sunlight.*****
LPT: When you are visiting a friend who is unemployed, don't ask him how the job search is going. Let them bring it up first if they need to do so.*****Your friend has been dealing with the stress of looking for work all day long, isolated, ruminating over what could happen, feeling self doubts. Having you come over is a mental health break from all that, a welcome distraction. Don't harsh that by asking this common questions and getting his mind back on that track again. 
LPT- If you wake due to stress and can't fall asleep, do a chore like emptying/reload dishwasher or put away laundry. You'll burn off your frustration and be able to settle nerves having a sense of accomplishment*****Burn frustration.  Rest well
LPT: Asking your coworkers and sharing with coworkers your Salary is not against any HR Rules. While an employee can say no, they don’t want to share, it two employees do, and your boss finds out, do not believe them when they say they can write you up for it. Sharing allows you to know your worth.*****
LPT: Don’t hide the things that make you unique. If you smile a certain way or have any thing about you that is not normal, be confident with it. People will find it cute or attractive because it makes you special.*****Edit: Holy crap this blew up! I just checked this after my class! Just wanted to say thank you to you all. I wanted you all to know that you are special and amazing.
LPT: If you want to develop a habit of waking up early, do something you like when you wake up.*****Personally, I like watching TV shows, so I tried watching an episode of whatever's interesting when I wake up. I wake up early like clockwork now.
LPT: Shop the international aisle in the grocery store (or an ethnic foods store) when buying universal items, such as spices, rices, beans, lentils, etc... The same product will be 75-90% cheaper when buying international/foreign brands as compared to the western/national brands.*****
LPT: Take a family picture at the beginning of any excursion involving a large crowd (theme park, day at the beach etc...). If someone goes missing, you’ll have a picture of them, and you’ll be able to provide specific details about what they were wearing.*****
LPT: just letting y'all know that olive oil dissolves tree sap*****You don't have to scrub for a week, you actually just need to rub oil on your hands for a minute and then wash it off with soap and all the tree sap will be gone.
LPT: wet the blade of your knife before cutting an onion*****Onions contain volatile sulphur compounds which are released when you cut/bruise the onion. When they come in contact with the moisture in your eyes, ~~they react and produce sulfenic acids~~ they can irritate your eyes and trigger your lacrimal glands to activate and start producing tears, and it's what makes you cry.  If you wet the blade of your knife before cutting the onion, those sulphur compounds will react with the water on the blade instead of getting in your eyes, so no more crying!  Source: am chemist  EDIT: fixed a scientifically incorrect part about what's actually making you cry  EDIT2: one bit I didn't mention and I gave for granted, USE A SHARP KNIFE! A dull knife will bruise the onion and make everything 10x worse so first and foremost you need to use a sharp knife, but that isn't only valid for this problem!
LPT: Take the time to do a full clean of your vacuum. Wash everything and cut out all the hair from the roller. It will make a huge difference in the cleaning quality and will last you a life time.*****Well guys... never thought my first front page post would be about a vacuum cleaner haha!
LPT: Add cinnamon and essential oils to a pot of water, boil on medium heat to fill your home with a festive, holiday scent and humidify the dry air.*****A quick and easy way to make your home smell lovely as fuck and humidify the air during the dry, flaky skin inducing winter months.  What you need:  A small pot.(I don't pay attention to actual sizes, so let's just say one of those little ones that are perfect for one ramen.)  Water, filtered or unfiltered- Doesn't fucking matter but fancy blogger type people will say filtered. (I fill it to about an inch and a half below the top)  A few shakes of cinnamon powder. (cinnamon sticks if you wanna get fancy)  As many drops of essential oil as you like. I use peppermint oil, balsam fir needle, or orange oil.  If you don't have essential oils and don't want to buy any, cinnamon alone smells really great and festive as well!  You can also add sliced fruit like apples or oranges if you wanna go all out.   Enjoy feeling like a festive ass adult who's killin it at having your shit together and making your house smell like Christmas.
LPT: Wake up a little earlier than your alarm? Don’t go back to bed and wait for your alarm. Waking up naturally instead of to some sort of stimuli will help you get off to a better and healthier start to your day.*****
[LPT] As the weather gets colder, make sure to check your tire pressure. In general, for every 10 degrees it drops, that's 1 less pound in your tire. It can make a big difference as we move from 80s to 30s.*****
LPT: How to meal plan like a champ*****My meal planning and grocery shopping habits are something I really pride myself on. Over the last 3 years, I've worked really hard to maximize efficiency in this area, therefore saving me a lot of time and money. I thought I would share my process and tips to help anyone out who might be struggling in this area. Please feel free to share any additional tricks you have!   **Get started.**  Take a look at your bank account history and add up all the money you spend on food each month. Factor in your grocery expenses, fast food, coffee, snacks from the gas station, etc. Find the average and use that as a point of comparison for how much you spend while meal planning. This part isn't mandatory but I find it really neat to compare. Commit to 1 month of meal planning. Your comparison results will be skewed if you go off track.   **Meal planning**  1. First you need to think about how all the parts of you life, habits, and preferences should factor into your plan. How many people do you need to feed? How many nights do you want to cook? How long will you realistically eat leftovers for? Do you have an obligation one evening that could affect your plan? It's really important to think about all of these things and seriously consider your family's habits. For example, I won't eat leftovers twice. If I plan for that, I always end up going off track because 3 day old food is just not appealing to me. Also, I don't feel like cooking a big meal every night, so I build in an "easy" meal that I can make with my toddler that doesn't take a lot of time (think Grilled cheese and tomato soup). I also enjoy spending Sundays preparing a big meal, so I know that will influence which recipes I choose for the week.  2. Choose your recipes. It's important to read the instructions and ingredients before adding them to your list. There is nothing more frustrating than getting home ready to make your meal, and realizing it should have been marinated overnight. Also, if you see an ingredient you are not familiar with, check google for substitutes. That way if you get to the store and they don't carry it, you already have an alternative in mind. This happens often with health foods which might only be carried at specialty stores. If you're trying to save money, consider which ingredients (such as meat) will be more costly. **Bonus:** If you can find recipes that use the same ingredients, this will save you money.   3. Figure out which recipes will be made which night. I personally plan my healthier meals at the beginning of the week because I'm more motivated. By Friday, I might want some comfort food to take a load off the stress of the week. There is some flexibility to switch around meals by night, but I like to space out my meals so that I'm not eating similar things two nights in a row. If you plan to eat out, be honest with yourself and add it in your plan/budget. Don't plan 7 nights of  cooking if you can't stick to it. If you plan a meal and eat out instead, you're wasting money and food. I personally plan 4 nights of real meals, 1 easy night, 1 "fend for yourself night" and 1 night of eating out.   4. Plan your lunch. Some people meal-prep lunches at night, but I find that takes way too long. I also don't want to meal prep 5 lunches on Sunday that I am sick of by Wednesday. I always make enough dinner to have left overs for both my husband and I for lunch and plan one free day to buy lunch. I would recommend this to anyone on a budget.    5. Plan your breakfast. The costs of coffee and breakfast sandwiches really add up. A quick, healthy breakfast is not hard to plan. I normally do oatmeal, fruit, eggs or english muffins. I pick one of those things and eat them all week. I will switch it up the following week. Each of these are good for a "grab n go" breakfast.    **Make your grocery list**  1. Throughout the week, keep a sticky note on your fridge. Every time you run out of something, write it on the list.  2. Make a list of all the ingredients from each recipe.  3. Take inventory. Anything on your list that's already in your pantry you can cross off. If you notice your low on a staple, add it to your list. Don't forget to consider non-food essentials (toilet paper, cleaning supplies, toiletries, etc)  4. Add all items from your collected list from the past week.   5. Share your list with family/roommates. They can tell if you if there is something you are forgetting or if they have a request.   6. Now re-organize your list by department. This is important. It will help you move through the grocery store more efficiently without having to go back for something you missed. I separate mine by: Dry, Frozen, non-food, dairy, bakery, meat, and produce.    **Get to the store**  1. Don't forget to grab your coupons!  2. At the store, stay focused! If it's not on your list, don't buy it. Period. Impulse shopping is no good.  3. Start with the inner isles. Canned goods, non-food, etc. those are heavier and nothing is worse than having cans on top of tomatoes.  4. Finish up with bakery, meat and produce. If you are planning healthy meals, this should be the bulk of your cart. Produce is cheap relatively cheap and if you fill your cart with it, you will save money!  5. Double check that you've crossed everything off your list before you leave!  **TIP:** Don't forget to buy on sale, but only if it's a smart move. *DON'T* "buy one get one half off" on perishable items that you won't eat within the week. *DO* take up good deals on your essentials (rice, frozen vegetables, oils, condiments). Make sure to compare sales. Sometimes the store brand price is already lower than the name brand sale.   There you have it! That's really my entire meal planning and shopping process. From there, all you have to do is start cooking. It takes practice to get it down, but when you've got it figured out, it starts to get easy.   **Here are some additional tips I would recommend:**  1. Type your meal plan with links to recipes and save them. When you don't feel like meal planning, you can resort to the archives.  2. If you don't have a food processor, get one! It's cheap and saves you so much prep time.  3. Crock pot meals are amazing for those nights you want to get home and just relax. Only problem is you have to prepare them the night before or in the morning.   4. Sign up for emails from sites like MyFitnessPal or Cooking Light. It's a great place for inspiration.   5. Plan to have a night that you don't need a recipe for. Grilled chicken and frozen broccoli requires like... zero brainwork. After a long day, that's important.  6. Remember that cooking is an art! Once you have enough experience in the kitchen, you don't need to spend as much time finding recipes. I'm at the point where I use recipes for inspiration,  but I change them depending on my preferences.   6. Remember to bring your lunch! What's the point in all this if you end up buying lunch everyday anyway?! Seriously, set an alarm on your phone if you have to. But DONT FORGET YOUR LUNCH.  7. Plan desserts. I have a weakness for cookies. I actually might be addicted. If I plan in a night of cookie baking, it helps me from running to McDonald's at 9pm.  8. Remember to stay stocked on your pantry staples. [This list](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/articles/basic-pantry-101.html) can help you determine what those are  Edit: sorry guys I really dont know how to format so I've had to mess around with this a lot!  **EDIT 2:** I've gotten some requests to share a sample meal plan. [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4s-npIJ0K85RktBMkF1dEduZ1lfV191bHhNcUo3dkVwUHp3/view?usp=sharing) is an example. It's not fancy at all! This is from a couple months ago, so I've made some changes to my eating habbits since then! Not drastically different than what I outlined in my post. 
LPT: Want to download the highest quality version of an Instagram photo? View the page source on desktop and find the line titled "og:image"*****Instagram tries to make it difficult to save photos outside of the app, but there's a pretty easy workaround.    Let's say you want to save this image to your desktop: https://www.instagram.com/p/BTO_dCkhxdQ/    Load it in it's own browser tab (I'm using Google Chrome), right click and select "View Page Source" (Ctrl+U): http://imgur.com/a/T45dd    Then in the page source search for "og:image". That URL links to the raw file. Copy and paste that image URL into a new tab and do with it as you wish! http://imgur.com/a/LWWQl
LPT: Follow the 2-minute rule. If it only takes 2 minutes to do, just do it.*****If you're a big procrastinator, this is a great and easy way to start fixing that problem. If it's something like taking out the trash, folding some clothes, or putting the dishes away, do them right there and then and don't put it off. If it only takes 2 minutes, get it out of the way!
LPT: The first time you give someone flowers, do it randomly. Don't wait for a special occasion.***** The random act of giving flowers can mean so much more than when they're expected.
LPT: if your cat is lost, put the litter-box outside. Most cats are lost close to home, and they can smell the litter box from up to half a mile away.*****My cat was lost and I got this great tip from the local vet.  (for the people buying me silver or gold, please save your money and go for a walk with one of the dogs in your local shelter instead)
LPT: If you're reduced to eating ramen so you can pay rent as I often am, go to the asian market or at least the asian aisle in your market. The packages generally come with much more interesting seasonings that do alot for the flavor of the soup and making you feel "fancy".*****Edit: wow! Would've never guessed that I would reap karma from a ramen life pro tip. Now I guess I'm gonna have to stock up before all you redditors buy my ramen
LPT: When speaking to an expert on something, if you're not sure what to ask them you can ask "what are the most common mistakes/problems?" You may learn something new.*****
LPT: If you regularly order food online from yours and your partner's accounts, stop using one of the accounts. After a while you will receive offers on the account that is dormant.*****
LPT: For you dog owners out there.*****
LPT: you can turn off those irrelevant and annoying Reddit notifications which have started popping up all of a suddon by clicking on the button in the top-left, going to settings, notifications, and then toggling off 'Trending'*****Don't deny it. Deep down, you always knew you could. You've just not gotten round to it, and we're putting up with it for absolutely no reason.  You can do it in under 10 seconds. It's okay. You got this.
LPT if someone reaches out to you saying they’re thinking of you, take note as they are most likely someone that feels lonely often and is conscious of when others may be feeling that way. Reciprocating the thought occasionally might make them feel less alone.*****
LPT: Take a videocamera and spend 10min filming every room and every item in your house. Upload footage to the cloud. If you are ever in the unfortunate situation of a house-fire, this will make the insurance claim thousand times easier.*****
LPT: If you’re a renter with low water pressure, buy a decent shower head. They can typically be installed in less than 5 minutes and make a huge difference.*****Update: Yes, of course you don’t have to be a renter to do this. I directed it toward renters because it is an inexpensive and easily reversible solution. Also, low-flow shower heads and water pressure issues are very common in rental properties which leads me to...  Apparently there is a very serious difference between water “pressure” and “flow.” This is a solution to the low “flow” issue, but most of you understood what I was trying to say anyway. Sorry for offending you water purists.  Additionally, don’t go out and buy anything super expensive for this. I can’t remember the model name of my shower head but it was about $20 and is Waterpik brand.  Happy showering!
LPT: If you find someone's wallet, take it to any branch of the bank that they have a card for. They'll know how to contact the owner.*****EDIT: So, now I know what "RIP my inbox" means. Holy ratfuck.
LPT: get your finances in order by your 20s or spend your 30s repairing all the damage.*****In my 30s I am constantly being reminded that I spent my 20s spending frivolously. My finances are a wreck, I have nothing in savings, and currently have a little less than $200 in the bank. I am just now making a budget. Don't be like me. Track and keep your finances in order early.  Edits:: -I am aware of living within your means and making ends meet. I didn't do either. I am very deep in debt.  -I was such an impulse buyer. I'm a little better now, but impulse buying is what has gotten me into trouble. -I have a bachelor's degree.  NOTE TO THOSE WITH RUDE COMMENTS:: I am NOT looking for sympathy. I'm not looking for handouts. I have been given an unfortunate lot in life and some of it is hard to deal with. I have some mental disabilities that make it extremely difficult to hold down a full time job. I'm not entitled. Nobody pays for my things.    Well this just blew up my inbox!
LPT: Cooling racks (like for cookies) are great for putting under a laptop, it improves airflow and can protect the laptop from liquid spills on your desk/table.*****
LPT: When someone compliments you, it's okay to just say "thank you." You don't have to give them the same compliment right back.*****
LPT: If you want to have a good standing with an employer and increase your chance of being a needed asset do the work nobody else wants to do and get good at it.*****
LPT: If you want people to leave you alone while you are traveling, just wear a surgical mask and people will give you plenty of space.*****
LPT: Most people at the gym are to busy with themselves to notice or think about you, so don't worry about it*****Edit: I meant "too busy", not "to busy". People at the gym aren't going to busy :c
LPT: Never leave water bottles, reading glasses, or anything else that can focus light in a spot that could get direct sunlight. A significant number of house/vehicle fires happen every year because of this.*****
LPT: Take the time to reflect on your time at the company you may currently work for. Are you still growing professionally and personally? Are your skills still developing? Sometimes it's wise to move on from a company if you're development is stagnant.*****
LPT: If you want to move up in a company/increase your work load, don’t just ask your manager for something more to do. Find a problem, then make yourself the solution. It shows initiative and is a lot better than just walking up and saying “I’d like more to do.”*****If you are just blindly asking, you’re putting them on the spot and they either won’t think of anything, or give you crap tasks that don’t further your progress in the company.    If you come to them with a specific task in mind, especially if it’s for a problem or issue you’ve identified and you already know how to correct it/complete the task with ease, it will get you a lot further.   It also shows a great deal of initiative and will have them start thinking of you for things in the future.   Edit:  A lot of you are interpreting this as just doing something and not asking.  I fully meant it to come off as asking your boss first.  I only meant it as it being a lot better to come to your boss with something in mind for a problem you have identified, rather than just walking up and blindly asking.     Edit 2:  there’s a lot of negative people here saying you just get overworked/not rewarded.  All I have to say to that is, sometimes you’ve got to get shit on before your seed will sprout. 
LPT: If you struggle to wake up and you do it late, leave everything done for next day (clothes ready, ingredients for your coffee at hand, etc.) That way you will be ready to go much faster.*****
LPT: If someone is repeating themself a lot, it's often because they don't feel like anyone is hearing or understanding them. Try making eye contact and rephrasing what they're saying, so they know they've been heard.*****
LPT: Before booking any overseas travel, check your passports expiry date. Some countries need your passport to have a minimum of 6 months left of validity before arriving. Some countries also will NOT accept an emergency passport. Check those dates people! (reposted)*****
LPT: Live support chat systems allow the business to see what you're typing in realtime, so only enter text you're 100% comfortable with.*****Almost all support live chat systems provide a "Sneak Peek" feature that allows a customer support agent to see what you're typing in realtime before you submit. This can work against you if you're negotiating a resolution and type something (however brief) that gets taken the wrong way. Keep your in-progress thoughts outside of the chat!

LPT: if you don’t care about football, go see a movie during the super bowl, there will be no lines and you might have the whole theater to yourself.*****
LPT: Most people are posting pics of them from the begining of the decade in order to show how far they've progressed in life. If you find that boring, how about using Google's servers to find out what you were EXACTLY THINKING 10 years ago*****This is sort of a double life pro tip, one that can be used to increase your privacy, as well as give you insights of how you acted 10 years ago, what you were interested in, how your interests grew, and just how stupid you might have been. Now before I continue, I happen to find this extremely fascinating, others may find this extremely creepy. However, do what you will with this information.  First, in order to start this, make sure you're **signed into Google using a Gmail account you've been using the longest**. The older the account, the more farther back you can look. Next go to [myactivity.google.com](https://myactivity.google.com) and you're almost there. Here where it may get creepy. It shows all your Google searches and how many times and at what times you visited any websites, searched anything on Google, and which apps you've opened. Yeah, pretty creepy. But whatever, I think you can delete it somewhere.  Next, you can click on the filter options, and just think back to when you created your Gmail account. I created mine sometime before 2012, so my account is perfect for this. Long story short, filter the options using only the dates and set it to January 1st, 20XX, whatever that might be for you. And there you go, look back to what you Googled and which apps you were using and whatnot. More often than not, this will be nostalgic, and a bit creepy. But whatever. After looking back for a bit, I started rememebering what video games I was playing, which YouTubers I used to watch, and what information I was Googling.  Stay safe and Happy New Years.  EDIT: It's organized in a very weird way. You cannot choose to view older information first. Newest is always at the top. Click "Before" instead of "After" and select the date to be January 20XX, being one year ahead of the year you wanna view. Also you must view newest to oldest and cannot change it. So you'll start on May 31st, all the way to May 1st. If you wanna look at it chronologically, you have to scroll all the way to the bottom of the page and scroll up slowly.  Also thanks for the gold, stranger.
LPT Whenever you receive a greeting card with money in it for your birthday (or any other special day), always act like you don't see the money and read the card out loud first. After that, then thank them for the money. People really appreciate when you take the time to enjoy their greeting cards.*****
LPT: Learn to look at food products labeling carefully. "Made with 100%..." is very different to "made from 100%..."*****
LPT: Write a fake pin number on the back of your credit card. That way if it gets stolen the person will only get 3 attempts before the ATM machine swallows the card.*****
LPT: Treat another persons phone or computer like you would their diary. Don't even touch it unless they allow you to. It's always for the best.*****
LPT - Have a look at a map of the area you live in. Pick 52 spots you've never visited, or are not familiar with. Write them down on individual scraps of paper, and drop them in a hat/nag/whatever. Commit to going to a random spot every week for a year.*****This works if you're alone, with a partner, a friend, dog, etc.   You'll get a new appreciation for your city, and you'll get some exercise.   The wife and I started this   a few weeks ago, and it's been awesome.  *edit* for aditional ideas.  What I did when I set this up was to pick 26 nature type places, and 26 commercial ones.  So depending on our mood and the weather we dip into the relevant hat and off we go.  All you need is a pair of shoes, and  raincoat or umbrella for wet days.  A camera is awesome too.  Outside is beautiful if you're out for a stroll and keep your eyes away from your phone.  Ohh... "nag" =bag.. Sorry!   *more editing* There are are 2 groups of very hesitant people in the comments. The 'my city is too dangerous' group and the 'my area is too boring' group.  Please don't put yourselves in danger.  The areas you pick should obviously be relatively safe.  And I realize density of 'interesting' spots will vary.  The spots you pick don't need to stand out as interesting though.   Just spots you haven't really explored, other than mindlessly passing through.   Here's what I'm getting at.  You may have walked down a street a bunch of times on your way to x, y, or z.   When you did that you were on a mission, and likely didn't take in your surroundings.   Go without a specific end point in mind, and with a sense of curiosity.   Curiosity is the key.  Here's how I picked spots.  Used Google maps on map view.  I looked for green areas, and zoomed in a bit to make sure they weren't private, then maybe switched to see if there were trees, or just fields, any water features, etc before deciding to add them.  Then I looked for yellow stretches along roads that denote commercial areas.  and added those.   Commercial areas are great, especially in quieter, or run down neighborhoods because you get mom 'n pop type places and never know what interesting things or people you might run into.     *alright, another edit* Lots of people are suggesting geocaching, or Pokemon Go.  Both are fun, and a great way to get off the  couch.  So is running, and strenuous hiking.  I think this is different because there is no specific thing to look for, or destination to reach.  We stroll to get a little air, and to give ourselves a chance to observe, interact with, and appreciate the details in our surroundings.       
LPT: If you're an impulse spender or find it too easy to drop money on something, translate the price of an item into the hours that you have worked to make that amount of money. It really puts in perspective the cash value of an item against the value of your time.***** 
LPT: When a stranger asks you to take a photo of a group, take several before and during the "3 2 1" countdown.*****Basically, just click the button from the time you get the phone through the final shot. People tend to appreciate candid shots and moments more than the staged ones. If nothing else, it gives them something to talk about later on. Of course... take the final one as well.
LPT: Charge a small "adoption fee" to prevent snake owners from using your free puppies or kittens as food.*****I have a coworker who routinely looks at online advertisements for free puppies, kittens, or bunnies. She will pretend to be getting the animal for her children, but will really take it home and feed it to her reticulated python. She admitted that she won't pay over 10$ to feed the snake. Charging a small adoption fee of $15 or $20 will deter her and other like minded individuals from dishonestly taking the animals for a food source.   Note: I understand that snakes are animals too, and need to eat. I'm not bashing on snakes or snake owners. I merely take issue with the dishonest means by which this is happening. In some examples that she shared with me, the previous owners are calling and texting to check in on the animals, so she lies to them. If these people care enough to check up on the animal, they most likely would not have given the animals away if the true intent were known. Sketchy.   Edit: Wow, this ended up being a really controversial topic. For the record, this is a true story. This woman is emotionally unstable, and quite frankly, doesn't have the mental agility to pull off a prank on this level as some have suggested. I do agree with many of you who have pointed out the possible warning signs of a sociopath, and I will definitely be reporting her. Thank you to all those who PM'd me resources and contact information.   Also, I had never considered the concept of the bait dogs/fighting dogs and I found that to be enlightening as well.  As some have mentioned, the dog fighting rings may be the bigger more prominent threat. There were many comments that mentioned the fee really doesn't solve the problem, and that solid interviewing and vetting of new owners is a better strategy. I do not disagree. The argument of spaying/neutering pets was also made, and again, I do not disagree. The purpose of this post was not to spark ethical debate about the food chain, or which type of animals should be labeled "food" vs. "pets". Nor was the purpose of this post to vilify snakes or their responsible owners. This story would have read the same, even if the animal she owned was a Saltwater Crocodile.   My goal in sharing this post was to raise awareness that there are sketchy people out there who are dishonest in their dealings, and who may not have your pet's best interest at heart. So, whether charging a fee, or conducting more extensive interviews, or spaying/neutering, we can all be a little more responsible with the animals we value, to make sure that they do not needlessly suffer. Hence the LPT.   #Iknowthatallsnakeownersarenotbad  #someofmybestfriendsaresnakes  #trollscandieinafire
LPT: If you started college at a 2 year school, then transfer to a 4 year school and dropped out without a degree, contact the 2 year school about Reverse Transfer Programs, you may have already earned an Associates Degree that you are not getting credit for.*****For more information, check out ReverseTransfer.org([https://reversetransfer.org/](https://reversetransfer.org/))
LPT: Use a shaker bottle to mix pancake batter. You'll have less dishes to clean after, and pouring them onto a pan is easier!*****Edit: I understand that over-mixing the batter makes the pancakes less fluffy. Just give it a few shakes instead.  Also, cleaning a shaker bottle takes 30 seconds. Fill it up with hot water, add a little soap, shake it like a salt shaker.   I use Kodiak Cakes mix, for anyone who is wondering. I think it's amazing, and it's also great for fried oreos. 
LPT: Put your phone into "Do Not Disturb" mode when showing someone something on your phone. It will keep any private information from popping up and can save embarrassment*****
LPT: Have a wood screw that is loose such as on a door hinge, drawer knob, etc, take a toothpick and put it in the hole the screw goes to, snap off the excess sticking out, and put the screw in again. It should tighten right up again for you.*****Edit: I should add that when I say door hinge, I’m talking cabinet doors like in the kitchen or bathroom, or at most interior bedroom doors. A toothpick isn’t going to hold an exterior entry door. I wrote the initial post with little fixes in mind and thinking of what pretty much every household probably has on hand.   As a bunch of these comments are stating, wood glue will give a better hold when combined with the toothpick, matchstick, or splinter of choice. I’ve never been a golfer, but will have to pick up a few golf tees for the toolbox after seeing a bunch of these comments, so thank you guys for that!  Thanks for blowing this post up everyone!  I saw a good handful of people who are going to be using these tricks in the near future, so Reddit saves the day thanks to all of you!!!
LPT: Look for the shady spot when you're leaving work, not when you get there. This way you know where to park the next day!*****
LPT: Even if measuring milestones and accomplishments is not part of your annual review at work, always keep a personal list with a short summary and dates so you can casually bring it up during those interviews.*****
LPT: If someone tells you they don't drink alcohol, don't ask them why.*****It's probably for a personal reason, and may be because they're an alcoholic. In any case, it isn't any of your business.
LPT: If you have a cat suddenly start peeing outside their litter box, take it to the vet to get checked for a bladder infection.*****Edit: Holy cow, that blew up.  Thanks you for the gold, dear internet strangers.
LPT: Most countries require your passport to be valid for 3-6 months AFTER your scheduled return date (US)*****Most countries require that your passports expiration date is atleast 3 months after your scheduled return date. Make sure you renew it before you travel even if you have a few months before it expires.  Eg. If you are travelling to France and returning July 21st, your passport has to be valid until October 21st.  EDIT: Alot of people have been caught by this it seems. I spent the last 4 hours at the passport office and got an expedited passport approved and printed. Will be flying out this evening. This is an option for people who live near a passport office and can get your flight pushed a day or two. It says appointment only but if you get there early you can try your luck with the walk in appointment.

LPT: If your dogs gets out and comes back, don't scold it. Reward it for coming back.*****
LPT: If You Have White Laundry That Has Yellowed, Do Not Use Chlorine Bleach (Clorox). Use Oxygen Bleach Instead. Also, For Severely Yellowed Whites, Use A "Blue-ing Agent" (Mrs. Stewart's Bluing).*****
LPT: Have a new person starting at work? Try to refer to your other colleagues by name whenever you're around the new person. Chances are they will have trouble remembering everyone's names at first so regular reminders can help them fit in*****
LPT: If you're trying to learn a new language try watching children's shows dubbed in that language. Children's shows tend to go over things like shapes, colors, animals, etc. and can help you learn basic words and sentences.*****Obligatory rip inbox. I was high af last night watching Malaysian kid's shows and realized that that would be a good way to learn the language, so thanks to every who agrees..  To anyone who is wondering what I was watching check out [Upin & Ipin](https://youtu.be/9mV6lV_1XMM>)
LPT: If your ceiling fan is really dusty you can use a pillow case to clean the blades without having dust rain down on everything below. Not sure how known this trick is but I thought everyone should know.*****
LPT: One way to help keep hanging out with friends as you get older is to pick a regularly a occurring thing you do together. Ex: every week watch Game of Thrones together, or a sports team (football is best since it’s once a week). Sounds silly when you're young, but keep this in mind in your 30s.*****
LPT: If you’re having trouble explaining something computer-related to your parents, instead of explaining it to them over to the phone, record yourself doing it and send them a video*****They'll be able to follow along better since they see it happening and will save everyone a lot of frustration  EDIT: Turns out my method of recording the screen is inefficient and ancient as fuck. Your recommendations are the shit, here's a compilation of what i saw+tried (will keep adding as they come in):  1. http://www.useloom.com/ -> This thing kicks ass, like how the fuck have i not known about this, you click a button and it records your screen, your camera and your mic so you can narrate what you're doing. Once you finish recording you INSTANTLY get a link to the already processed video to share. No waiting time. Seems like it lets you edit the video as well.  2. github.com/justinfrankel/licecap -> similar to the above, allows you to record a part of your screen in giphy. No audio/cam though. Great tool  3. https://www.teamviewer.us/ -> for realtime support, install it on your parents laptop and then whenever they have trouble just take control of their desktop remotely and do it for them. Brute force that shit  4. Have parents that understand tech -> apparently it's more effective than all of the rest combined
LPT: If someone cuts you off in traffic and you feel your adrenaline kick in, you're entering fight or flight mode. Take a few deep breaths and choose to move on with your life.*****
LPT Good way to recover a stolen vehicle*****If you've ever had a vehicle stolen, you may not feel like you have any recourse. This isn't true. Go down to your local garbage company's truck yard at about 5am and hand out flyers to the drivers with information about your car. Offer $50 or a case of beer and chances are that we (garbagemen) will find it. We cover every street and alley several times per week and are generally pretty aware of our surroundings.  I had my stolen motorcycle recovered within a week, and another driver recovered a different stolen bike about a year later.
LPT - When you have an item you changed your mind on at the grocery store (especially perishables) just give it to the cashier. We really don't mind and you don't have to be sorry about it. It makes everyone's lives easier and we won't have to go through the store looking for misplaced items.*****edit - RIP my post replies !! I'm glad everyone liked the LPT. I know some cashiers will give you a hard time about it but the majority of us really don't mind... and as people said. Do this at ALL retail stores!   Edit 2 - wow front page and more upvotes than all my posts combined! Please please take this advice. If your cashier is mad about then they can screw themselves because it's not even their job to put it back! Grocery stores have people for that! 
LPT: Set the link for a random Wikipedia article as your browsers home page, every time you open the browser you'll learn something new.*****The link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random
LPT: If you own a pet or are taking care of one, look up the nearest emergency veterinarian right now so you know exactly where to take the pet in case of an emergency.*****If the animal is suffering, it's best to know exactly where to go rather than wasting precious moments looking up the nearest pet hospital.  Make sure it's open on Sundays just in case.
LPT: Evacuating and worried if your freezer kept your food safe? Put an ice cube in a ziploc bag and keep it in the freezer. If the ice melts and refreezes it will be misshapen indicating a thawing.*****Taking LPT back to its roots! A quick and easy check to see if your freezer loses it's cool. If the ice melts and refreezes in a different shape chances are the food in the freezer isn't safe.
LPT: Google your kids prospective name before theyre born*****When you are trying to pick a baby name, make sure you google the first and last name. My kid is now older but I realized I messed up about a year ago. Did a quick google search to find out my son is named after a high ranking officer in the confederate army and gave probably the most racist speech in the history of the united states. Does not help that we're white and in the deep south. We certainly didnt know that. We struggled finding a name and when we could finally agree upon one we were only down to the middle name. Middle name doesnt match but still.  &#x200B;  Edit: Im really not worried, but I thought it was a good LPT. Its not hitler or robert e lee or someone as famous as that, but there will definitely be folks, especially in the south, that would recall the name. just checked and there are statues, parks, and highways named after him....
LPT: in college, if you miss an assignment, don't go to the instructor and ask if you can turn it in late for partial credit. Do the assignment first, then give it in asking for feedback and any credit theyre willing to give. They will be far more receptive.*****
LPT: If you have pet fur all over your clothes and you don't have a sticky roller, wet your hands and brush off the fur. Most of it will come off.*****
LPT when testing your fire alarms pay attention to where your pets go hide. They will likely go to this spot during a real emergency.*****
LPT: if you have to pay a company to work for them it's a scam, walk away*****
LPT: All signs indicate that this summer will be the hottest ever in North America. If you will need to buy an air conditioner or will have trouble paying higher electric bills, you should start saving for this right now.*****
LPT: when checking out apartments or condos, ask the leasing agent or realtor for 10 mins of privacy so you can sit and listen. If you can hear ANY human activity, the walls are too thin.*****
LPT: don't recommend a friend for a job unless you've seen them work or you are willing to risk both relationships. A good friend isn't always a good worker.*****Someone who is a good friend doesn't necessarily  translate to someone who has a strong work ethic.    Recommending them only for them to mess up reflects badly on you and could ruin the friendship and your relationship with the employer. 
LPT: Do an online search for which restaurants give out free birthday meals. When your birthday rolls around, your email will be full of coupons for free meals that don't expire for about a month.*****
LPT: When you go to a big event with lots of people, change your phone lock screen background to a screenshot of text of a friend’s phone number. This way if you lose it and someone picks it up, they can immediately contact your friend without having to unlock or reset your phone.*****My friends and I have had backgrounds that say “IF LOST CALL OR TEXT” + one or two of our phone numbers. It’s saved our asses more than once!
LPT: Help protect your grandparents from scammers by saying your name when they answer the phone.*****A common scam people try to pull on the elderly is to call them and say something like "Hi Grandma, I'm stuck and I need money to get home."  often the victim will say "Oh is this Jake?  Where are you?" after hearing a name the scammer will assume that identity "Yes, this is Jake, my car broke down in another province and I need you to transfer me money to get it repaired so I can come home."    The problem here is the victim asked who was on the other end of the phone.  When calling your grandparents, when they pick up the phone you say "Hi Grandma, it's Jake."   That way they know that if one day someone calls asking for money, they not only know not to ask who it is by giving a name.  But they also know that if the person does say it's you that that couldn't be true because you always give your name when you call.   I started doing this with my grandmother after she told me she got a call one time just like the one I described above.  Someone called and said they were in jail and needed money for bail.  She said "Oh, is this Jake?" and the scammer said "Yes it is."  They insisted she didn't need  to come  to the police station but that they definitely needed the money.  She went to the bank to make the withdrawal and the excellent tellers realized it was a scam and stopped her.   Since then I told her I would always give my name when I call and have been doing so for years.   She had one other time someone called and she asked who was on the phone (asking for mine or my brothers name) and the scammer said it was me.  She realized that couldn't be right because I always say it's me after saying hello.
LPT: Bring your old unwanted clothes to the homeless shelter instead of places like Value Village or Goodwill*****I've been doing this for a while now and the shelter is always so grateful to get more clothes. They are in need of winter jackets and shoes/boots the most this time of year as well.
LPT: When working retail, replace "Sorry for the wait/trouble" with "Thank you for your patience"*****A few months ago I started working for a coffee shop in a rich neighborhood.  A lot of customers get upset if they don't get their drink right away, and it doesn't help that we're often very busy.  I've found that switching "Sorry about the wait" with "Thank you for your patience" makes quite the difference.  "Sorry for the wait" is a very negative phrase.  "Sorry" implies that the listener has to deal with something unpleasant due to a fault of the speaker.  "Wait" implies frustration and impatience.  "Thank you for your patience," on the other hand, is much more positive.  "Thank you" is flattering to the customer.  People feel good when they're thanked.  "Patience" implies calm and understanding.  On top of this, it's easy to say with a smile.  People tend to not feel as comfortable getting upset at somebody who is smiling.  It's a lot harder to say a negative statement like "sorry for the wait" with a smile, as saying "sorry" means you are expressing sympathy or admitting fault.  Of course it's not going to work 100% of the time.  Some people are just irrational and impatient.  But I'd say a good 90% of the time when I use "thank you for your patience," the customer responds with "no problem" or "don't worry about it."  **EDIT**: Okay, so a few things to mention here.  A lot of people are saying "Thank you for your patience" is condescending.  Tone is a very important thing here.  If you say it in a tone like an elementary school teacher speaking to 10 year olds, then yes it is condescending.  When using this phrase, you have to use a tone that shows the customer that you genuinely are grateful that they have been patient.  And the key here is being genuine.  If you don't give a shit about their wait, then no matter how you say it it's going to come off as condescending.  If you genuinely appreciate that they are waiting, your tone is going to come off much more friendly and appreciative.  This LPT won't really work if you just use your generic "retail voice."  Some people are saying that the apology is better because you are taking responsibility for it.  The thing I've learned about retail is that if you take responsibility for every thing that goes wrong, you're going to have a miserable time.  If it is your own mistake, such as ringing in an order wrong, an apology usually won't hurt.  But there's no need for you to apologize if somebody else made the mistake, or if a customer came in with a large order, or if you can't do something due to company policy, or really for anything that happens outside of your control.  Saying "sorry" in those situations only makes you a target for the customer's anger.  People are inclined to mimic the behaviors of those around them.  If you act in a very positive manner with a smile and positive words, most people will act positively in return.  If you speak with many negative words, it makes it more likely that the person will react more negatively in return.  It's not going to work 100% of the time.  Play it by ear.  Some situations may work better if you apologize.  Some people would rather have their ego stroked with a "thank you," while other would rather hear you apologize.  But I've found in my experience working with a large number of customers every day, people tend to react more positively to "thank you for your patience" simply because it is a more positive sounding statement.

[LPT] After witnessing/being involved in a traffic accident or crime, make a voice note of what you saw, heard, and felt before speaking with anyone. Your memory of the incident will change drastically with each encounter, and the notes you make will stand up in a court as more viable evidence than*****edit: than... mere verbal recollection.   went to bed. Sorry, y'all! (east-coaster here)  ... also to everyone mentioning photos. Yes, do this.  I was rear-ended on my bike by an 87 year old man in a Buick, who said I "came out of nowhere," which to the world sounds like an ass-hole cyclist who swerved in front of a car. That wasn't the case. I had been waiting to turn left, so was in the left lane (which becomes a turn lane for a more prominent intersection up the road). I was waiting for a minute or two, waiting for oncoming traffic to cease when along he came, on his way home, driving in auto-pilot, neglecting to see a bike that isn't on his radar to notice. There were 6 witnesses who all said that I had been waiting, and was there long before he was. The one witness who saved my ass left a voice note on his phone detailing everything he witnessed, that I had been waiting. That he expected the car to stop, To swerve. I got unlucky. This witness was the only one who had a clear view of the incident, and in his voice note, you can hear the sirens from the ambulance and police.   They thought I'd died, sent me to the hospital, and charged the old geezer with following too closely.   I saw him in court, after everything was said and done, and he never once apologized.  Update: I get it, get a dash cam. I was hit while on a bike. I was rear-ended. The person who left the voice note was on a bike across the street. Sure, the driver should have had a dash cam. Tell him that.
LPT: Treat your monthly savings goal like a bill. At the end of the month, hold yourself accountable to “pay it off” like you would your rent or your utilities. This will keep you on track for your savings goals.*****
LPT: Carry around a card in your wallet/purse with some important phone numbers like parents or friends. If your phone dies or you don’t have it, you have all the numbers you need, and you can use a pay phone or borrow someone’s phone.*****I think everyone considers this but no one really does it. I personally can’t remember more than 5 or so numbers. Ironically, I thought of this while walking home from the gym, but I had left my phone at my apartment to charge so I couldn’t post this yet lol. Hope this helps  Edit: my very first silver!?! Thank you kind stranger!!!
LPT: View your time as an investment, and pay attention to what gives you the greatest return*****Think of how stingy you are with your money: if someone on the street asks for $10, you're not giving it to them. There's no way you're giving a 30% tip for a normal dining experience. And so on.   And yet so many of us just waste ungodly amounts of our time. We throw it away, every day. I know I do unless I'm careful. What helps me to not waste time is to see it as an investment, and to keep track of the returns I get for my investment.   This approach has led me to recognize that some things offer incredible immediate return on investment: a night spent learning a new song on my preferred instruments, for example, gives me a lifetime of being able to play that song. That's an incredible return. Other investments are more like low-interest, high security, long-term investments: going to the gym, eating right, etc. Some, like reading good books, are kind of a combination of both.   But many activities are worthless from an investment perspective: whatever benefit they seem to give doesn't last any longer than the activity itself. Reddit is a great example: I can get super-invested in a Reddit conversation, but at the end, the second I shut down my computer, I've gained nothing in return. It gives me absolutely nothing of value. I've invested my time into junk.   Edit: Some obvious things here. First of all, what's valuable and not is ultimately your own personal judgement. If you feel that your time spent on reddit helps you build the life that you want, then by all means, fill your boots. It doesn't build the life that I want, though - and yes, I'm aware that that seems hypocritical, but the fact is that I am highly aware that I'm procrastinating right now, and that I'll loathe my time spent on reddit when I lay my pretty head down to sleep tonight.   EDIT: SORRY I CRITICIZED REDDIT OMG. But for real, maybe you guys are all just a hell of a lot more disciplined on here than I am. You come for salient information, trenchant and high-minded interactions with others, and then you sign out in a crisp and efficient manner. Not I. Reddit is one of my boogeymen, so feel free to substitute your own time-waster.  Final edit: holy smokes, if I would have known this was going to blow up, I would have taken more than 45 seconds to write it and would have made some things a bit clearer. There's some confusion or perhaps defensiveness about the point I was trying to make. First of all, the examples that I used were all solitary pursuits, but that was just random - for instance, for myself, I don't think that there's a better investment of my time than playing music with my friends, or going on trips with friends and family. Those memories last a lifetime. Absolutely worth every second - and dollar. Secondly, I definitely don't want to imply that time invested in experiences is a waste - that's the exact opposite of what I'm trying to say. Experiences, rather than material things, are what I've chased for most of my adult life.   Really, this never should have blown up because it's not profound in the least. We all know that wasting time leads to unhappiness. All I was trying to say is that one strategy that has helped me to avoid wasting time is to see time spent on something as an investment, and to question what return on it I'm getting. Investing my time in learning a new skill, being a good husband and father, making new memories with friends and family - those investments will yield a good life. Other investments won't - eating junk food late at night on Reddit, for example. And for me, yes, Reddit is a serious time sink - something that I'm trying to deal with.   Lastly, I'd push back a tiny little bit against people saying that time spent enjoying yourself isn't wasted. Mostly, I agree, but sometimes, avoidance takes the form of enjoyment: if there's something that I know I need to do, and I watch Netflix instead, hell yeah I enjoy myself during that time. Doesn't mean that it wasn't a shitty investment of time, though. So, don't confuse avoidance/escapism with true enjoyment.
LPT: If your dog is addicted to tennis balls, call a local racquet club and ask if they sell their used balls. Yesterday my local club gave me over 100 for free!*****I took 40 of them to the local dog park. Not a single one left today when I went, which means some dogs had a good time! [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/pVaoMOx.jpg)  EDIT: Yes, tennis balls can be bad for your dogs teeth. If you don't want to use them, fine. Those that do, it is indeed smart not to let them have free reign with them. But doesn't this go with everything we give our dogs? So use your own common sense and your own judgement and give your dog what you want. Just spoil the dogs, that's what is important.

LPT: if you are creating a PowerPoint presentation - especially for a large conference - make sure to build it in 16:9 ratio for optimal viewer quality.*****As a professional in the event audio-visual/production industry, I cannot stress this enough. 90% of the time, the screen your presentation will project onto will be 16:9 format. The "standard" 4:3 screens are outdated and are on Death's door, if not already in Death's garbage can. TVs, mobile devices, theater screens - everything you view media content on is 16:9/widescreen. Avoid the black side bars you get with showing your laborious presentation that was built in 4:3. AV techs can stretch your content to fill the 16:9 screen, but if you have graphics or photos, your masterpiece will look like garbage. 
LPT: If you're thinking about turning your hobby into a profession, be aware that it will no longer feel like a hobby in short order, and may not have anywhere close to the same enjoyment.*****I'm sure this doesn't apply to every skilled hobbyist out there, but speaking for myself, and a lot of artists I've seen try to build successful businesses from their art, I can say that there is a good chance that you will hate what you do as much, if not more than whatever you're doing now for employment. Especially if you have no experience in self-employment or know how to manage yourself with discipline and dedication.  I've been building gaming terrain for a living for close to a decade now, most of that time it's been my primary income source, and while I build everything with passion and perfection that I take pride in, it also *suuuuuuuuuuucks.* I often hate working on this stuff and only feel enjoyment when I'm done and don't have to look at it on the worktable any longer. Before it was a profession I had great enjoyment for the process, but now I just can't help but count the minutes that I'm wasting, the cost-to-time-pay ratios, and so on. The business aspect of it has taken over my life completely and contributed to a real degradation in my mental health, culminating in a major breakdown last year.  If you're going to turn your hobby into a business:  * Start it as a side job, don't get ahead of yourself. Start slow and small. * Manage your time, learn to put only a certain amount of time into your work per day, per week.  * Never start getting in the habit of taking on more work than you can handle in those hours. Be strict about this. * Avoid "Commission Hell" where you get backed up working on custom projects for people and at the same time have to do other work to keep the lights on. * Charge appropriately. Don't sell too cheap because you're desperate to be seen. Don't charge more than your quality is worth. See what comparable work is being sold for and judge yourself critically. * Cramming will destroy your soul. If you get in the habit of working past your scheduled hours into the wee hours of the morning to meet a deadline, you WILL burn out very quickly. If you're doing this, you don't have a good work ethic, you've made a mistake in your judgement of what you can accomplish. * Motivation is a lie, a passing mood, if you wait for motivation to get work done, it will never get done. You need *discipline.* If you have a hard time with this regularly, you need to learn how to push yourself *before* you go into business for yourself.  Enjoy your hobbies as hobbies and only think of changing this dynamic if you are absolutely sure and driven to take it to another level. Keep your working life and your resting/recreation time separate, or you may end up regretting it.  Edit: Let me restate what I said at the top, since some people are dismissing the whole post. *This is a common occurrence with artists and hobbyists who take their passion and turn it to work*, it's **NOT THE RULE**. If you are doing what you love, wonderful. This doesn't always work for everyone though, and it's better to be prepared for something other than what you imagine going in or you might get in over your head and hate something you once loved. I'm not discouraging anyone from pursuing their passions, just the opposite, preserve your passions and pursue them with the right goals and mindset. Even the most fun activity is *work* when you have to do it 8 - 12 hours a day, so prepare yourself to *work.*
LPT: If you receive great service from an organization, consider sending written appreciation to the representative who assisted you. It can go a long way toward his/her professional development and look better in their portfolio.*****
LPT: Corporations exist to make money(for other people). HR is not your friend, and its not a "family"*****I bring this up as someone who has been a Software Engineer for about 18 years now. I have been a "corporate whore" in the sense that I have jumped ship every 1-2 years in my career, except for one position where I was there for 4 years.   Having been to a lot of corporations, it became apparent to me early on in my career that HR is more about protecting the corporation, and mitigating the risks of lawsuits as apposed to protecting the interests of the employee.  In leaked Target/Walmart videos that attempted to paint labor unions as horrible, they used phrases like "open door policy" (referring to an employee being able to discuss anything with a manager/employer, which would be removed if big bad labor unions got in the way), or "we are a family."  In no uncertain terms should you view your employer as family. In most cases you are an expense, and it really is a race to the bottom; how little can they do for you in return for you working for them and generating revenue/value.  A Job/Career is simply an agreement between what you think your value is, and what the corporation feels you are worth as an expense. The more confident you are in yourself, and the more you look for other opportunities, the better off you will be.   Working extra hours above 40 hours a week, if you are salaried anyway, is something we all do/did, and its only when you are older and wiser that you realize that extra time is not worth the extra 1% bump in your salary. Shopping around for other companies can and do bump you 5-20% depending on role/responsibilities. Doing so constantly is the best way to maximize your income in the long run.  That being said, there are exceptions to the rule. The company I was at for 4 years contributed 50% match to my 401k, up to the federal limit. So if I put in 16k, they would match 8k, with a 4 year vesting period. Situations like that are useful for retirement.   Before the 1970's, it was considered good practice to reinvest in your workforce, provide them with equity/pensions as a way to retain people. As automation/technological revolutions occurred, the value of each individual lessened. Additionally, during the 1970's, a new train of though started being taught in business schools that quarter over quarter profits for shareholders were more important than anything else. As a result, "trim the fat" became a mantra that future executives would hold dear, as well as be compensated against.  Had a good quarter? Awesome. Had a bad one? Perhaps we should replace you.  As an employee, your goal should be to gain as much as you can. Treat your employer with respect, but understand you are an expense. The days of loyalty are something corporations and HR love to talk about, but it seems to be a one way street. Don't settle for less than what you are worth.

You can also stretch the sock and secure it with a rubber band.
LPT: When on a budget go to the Goodwill of a higher income community than your own.*****Goodwills are more or less a reflection of where they are located, meaning buying from a Goodwill near you is like going to a local yard sale. Where as going elsewhere can be a treasure trove.   Bonus LPT: The more expensive the area the more stuff you'll find; often people of certain wealth do not want to be seen shopping at Goodwill and will only drop items off.  Edit: Goodwill was meant to be interchangeable with thrift stores in general. Goodwill was just the one I picked.  Edit: From reading posts it appears Goodwill is not as benevolent as they seem. If you would like to donate, research how your Goodwill or other thrift stores deal with their donations and wear the money goes.   Edit: Many communities may have distribution center in which the items brought in are spread to other locations.   Edit: I know the LPT may not work for every store or location, however I am posting from experience and just wanted to share something I noticed. (My vote, look anyway it's a thrift store, you never know what you'll find. Plus the second LPT still has a chance to work as it means less competition.)  Thank you everyone for your comments (positive and negative) You guys are awesome!
LPT: If you take showers when you're tired or hung over, buy a cheap shower chair. Sitting under the cascading water as it slowly reinvigorates you is amazing and relatively inexpensive.*****
LPT: If you're taking a foreign language class and have to prepare a journal, essay, presentation, etc., use ideas and plot lines from sitcoms.*****For just about every Japanese language assignment, I wrote about a Seinfeld episode as if it happened to me. I went to the Hamptons, installed a garbage disposal into my shower, tried to employ the homeless to pull rickshaws, and tried to sneak a rye bread into my girlfriend's parents' house. I even did my cultural presentation on Festivus.   These assignments are meant to practice your language skills, so veracity doesn't matter. And using sitcoms is ideal because it grounds your writing into reality, so you won't encounter obscure terminology or fantastical scenarios. Plus, it makes these assignments worthwhile and fun as you're not wracking your brain to come up with something more interesting than what you had for breakfast.
LPT: If dealer asks why you want to sell your car, say you're looking to upgrade. If you say other reasons like need the money, moving town, etc., they will lowball you with the price offer knowing you're desperate to sell it, and will most likely take whatever they offer.*****
LPT: Save your PowerPoint presentations with a .pps extension instead of .ppt. They'll open directly in presentation mode and PowerPoint will close when the slideshow is over.*****
LPT: In places with free 30 minute WiFi(airports and hotels), you can clear the cookies on your browser and register again to refresh the timer.*****You can also go in incognito mode, so your phone doesn't store cookies. Free WiFi for all!
LPT: When you cringe from something embarrassing you used to do in the past, treat it as a good feeling. The cringe means that you're recognizing that you've gotten more mature with time.*****
LPT: Take a screenshot of your mobile boarding pass before boarding an airplane so if you lose internet access, you can still pull it up.*****
LPT: If you buy ground beef in bulk and freeze it, repackage it in serving-sized plastic baggies and completely flatten them. They'll stack nicely in your freezer and the larger surface area will allow them to thaw more rapidly when you need them.*****
LPT: Avoid going to the zoo on fridays in May. Elementary schools usually plan field trips at the end of the school year and fridays are especially busy.*****Edit: Applicable to the United States only.  Edit 2: Many Redditors do not know how to apply advice to their own lives.
LPT: Before using your credit card or debit card in ANY machine, make it a HABIT to tug on the card reader with good force. You'll reduce the chances of your card being skimmed...by a lot.*****Information Security Engineer at a Bank reporting in. Users don't realize how easy it is for a credit card to be skimmed while doing day to day activities. I'm currently investigating multiple ATMs getting skimmers installed and looking almost identical to the original reader. ATMs generally are impossible to dismantle with human force. Tug on that reader with all your might. Wiggle it as well. If it moves even slightly, move on. Do not stick your card in it. Call me paranoid but if you see the amount of gas station pumps and atms I've seen get hijacked, you'll understand why tugging is now a religious habit.   **Edit 1: I didn't think this would blow up. I wrote this sitting from my desk dealing with ATM fraud for work. I'm glad it helped some of you. I'm also sorry in advance for those of you that said this was a repost. I'm a year old redditor and didn't see that it was.**  **Edit 2: I can't answer everyone's questions. I'm trying. For the police officer AMA and becoming a Security Engineer AMA tag me so I get notified.**
LPT: Do not listen to anyone who tries to explain to you that you can afford more than you think you can.*****These people usually are trying to get something (money) out of you, or have bad financial management skills and are (intentionally or not) trying to drag you down to your level.    Edit: Down to THEIR level lol  Edit 2: Thanks for silver, fam!
LPT: When you start a new job make sure to keep the job description. That way you can easily update your Resume or LinkedIn with the new job at a later date.*****
LPT: Potatoes are cheaper than Ramen, have more nutritional value, and will keep you full longer*****https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato#Nutrition  Edit:  1. Font page! Holy smokes! Thank you :)  2. I'd like to take this moment of fame and leave this recipe book for eating cheap and healthy. Discovered it a while ago on NPR.  http://www.leannebrown.com/   3. I would like the comments put into categories and submitted to r/dataisbeautiful  * Irish jokes  * The Martian references  * Latvia jokes  * Lord of the Rings references  * Stories/recipes  * Pseudoscience claims about how potatoes are bad for you  * Claims about how potatoes are too hard to cook  
LPT: if you know someone who's feeling low, is dealing with a down turn, is feeling depressed or anxious. Do not tell them that they can come talk to you or "PMs are open". Go and actually talk to them!*****Most people don't want to be a burden on others, and by saying something that is actually quite noncommittal, you're not really helping them much by asking them to make the first move apart from feeling good about yourself.  Since a lot of people also say this kind of stuff, it's not easy to figure out if someone actually means what they're saying or not.  If you want someone to open up to you, show them that you mean it and strike a conversation with them. Rather than asking them to take the risk of coming to you themselves, since most would rather choose to keep it in instead!        Edit: a lot of people have written comments opening up or expressing their situation and/or loneliness, then immediately deleted their comment!    To those people, I am sorry to hear about that! I've read all of the comments even if I can't physically respond to them! I hope things turn out alright in the end!
LPT: When asking someone out, always give them your number instead of asking for theirs. Giving them the option to contact you is a sign of respect, and it takes a lot of the pressure off of them after being put on the spot.*****
LPT: When tightening your budget, commit to simultaneously raising your quality of life by every means available to you.*****I'm talking about things like taking advantage of everything that's free (libraries, museums, galleries, national parks, whatever floats your boat), tidying up and shifting things around in your home so it looks better, making time to hang out with people who lift you up, preparing the food and playing the music and wearing the clothes you like best. It helps the whole experience to be positive and uplifting and empowering instead of just feeling like deprivation.
LPT: think of purchases as a percentage of your budget/account balance rather than their actual cost.*****I started doing this recently, it means I’m significantly more sensible. Sure that crate of beers might only be 8 pounds but if that’s 30% of what I’ve got left till pay day, is it worth it?
LPT: When starting to run, concentrate solely on form. Keep your hips, spine and neck aligned. Minimize up and down movement. Run in as straight a line as possible. By week 3 or 4, running at a steady pace will feel effortless.*****
LPT: Ever get corrected on calling someone by the wrong name? Respond with, "What did I say?" It implies that you truly knew the person's name but your mouth said something different, which can help you feel less embarrassed.*****My grandpa does this all the time but because he's legit old and no one expects him to get it right.  Also useful for times when you use words incorrectly. Just a mannerism that I thought I should adopt.
LPT for you students out there studying content heavy subjects. Instead of blindly reading and memorising, explain the concept out loud to an imaginary audience. This helps you understand the concept better while also testing yourself.*****For bonus memory, wait a short while (5-10mins) before reading to check if you were correct. Some studies have showed that testing yourself with delayed feedback leads to better memory than immediate feedback 
LPT: Thinking about or just taken up a new hobby or interest? Unless you're sure you're going to commit to it don't tell your family in the run up to Christmas. That is unless you want a load of new books/equipment relating to the new hobby that you may never use.*****Edit: thanks for my first front page!  Edit 2: I do realise that I am lucky to have a supportive family. I'm not being ungrateful, I just don't like unnecessary gift buying.
LPT: If you have an elderly friend on a tight fixed income, offer to look over their cable bill with them. They're probably paying for more than they use.*****My elderly friend has paid $3500 over the past 3 years for TV services. She doesn't own a TV.  This tip applies to everyone, but the elderly seem especially vulnerable to predatory up-selling behavior. (In my area, cable TV+landline phone+internet are through the same company.) Go through the bill line by line and confirm that you know what a charge is and that it is something that is used. If you don't know what something is, call. If something isn't necessary, drop that service. Even if it is necessary, call and see if you can get it cheaper. They won't automatically drop the price for you unless you ask. It may take a lot of talking and jumping through hoops, but even a small deduction can make a difference for someone living on a small retirement income.
LPT: Whenever someone recommends you a place to check out, star it on Google Maps. Next time you're in that city/state, you'll have a bunch of stars to visit.*****I like to star everything and everything people recommend to me. Say someone mentions this great seafood restaurant in Charleston, South Carolina. Now, while I am not planning on going to Charleston ever, I star it on Google Maps. If I ever visit Charleston in my life, I have at least one place now that I should check out.  Edit: I'm admittedly a Googly fanboy but are there any other apps where saving locations is this simple? Very curious, thanks!  Edit2: first front page post! Please excuse me while I hijack this post to say hi, future employer! No, I was not lying about making it to the front page of Reddit once. 
LPT: The bowline knot may be the most useful knot, because it it secure and can be tied and untied easily. You can do it in 4 simple steps.*****
LPT: If you know someone who cares about everyone around them a lot, please, ask them if they are okay from time to time*****I have seen, with time, that people that care a lot about other people, it's sometimes because they have trouble taking care of themselves.  EDIT: wow, my first gold! Thank you kind stranger!
LPT: When making homemade fries, after slicing the potato, soak the slices in a bowl of cold water. Some of the starches will release into the water, which makes the inside of the fries tender while the outside remains crispier.*****Place them in a large bowl and cover with cold water, then allow them to soak for two or three hours. (You can also stick them in the fridge and let them soak for several hours or overnight.) When you're ready to make the fries, drain off the water and lay them on two baking sheet lined with paper towels.
LPT: Refrain from using fabric softener on your socks; it lessens the absorption causing them to wear out at a much faster rate. Same goes for towels! Thanks Mom!*****Edit: Best answer so far, thanks Reddit!  https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/6i7asx/lpt_refrain_from_using_fabric_softener_on_your/dj4jqrd?context=3  
LPT: When meeting someone for the first time, try and use their name as early as possible; eg, 'Nice to meet you, [Name]'. You'll have a greater chance at recalling their name and will feel more confident in addressing them, thereby earning their respect.*****I know it sounds like a no-brainer but I see this happen all the time and I've certainly experienced immediately forgetting a name I was only just given. The only thing worse than saying 'I'm sorry, what was your name again?' is having someone say it to you. People like hearing their own name, especially from someone they've just met. Make a habit of saying their name in subsequent sentences and you won't go wrong.
LPT: When trying to find a small fly in a room, don't keep looking around. Instead go to the corner of the room and stare at the opposite corner. Your brain can spot even the most minuscule changes to its surroundings and will see the fly instantly.*****If anyone has a LPT on how to catch them once you find them, I would really appreciate it.
LPT If you're moving into a new apartment, take photos before putting any furniture in. That way you will already have pictures when moving out.*****
LPT: Before going to shop for a piece of furniture, snap a couple pictures of the room you're shopping for, it makes it much easier to match shapes and colours later when you're at the store.*****
LPT: If your neighbors aren't home and a courier leaves their package with you that needs to be signed for, sign your address, not your name. That way the person who owns that package can see the signature online and go to your house to collect it.*****I recently ordered a package on line. I was expecting a call/email saying when they expected it to be delivered. I got an email to say my package had been delivered and signed for. True enough there was a signature in the email - but it wasn't mine or my housemates and I didn't recognize it. I spent ages online trying to find a contact number for the courier - no luck so had to drive out to there storage unit 2 days later after work. The gave me a number for a driver who told me he left it in another apartment 5 doors down.  The neighbors gave it to me when knocked on the door (but didn't explain why they hadn't dropped it over to me in the previous 48 hours). I was thinking after that if they had signed they're address as the signature, i would have seen it and been to get the package without any hassle.  EDIT: this is the signature they provided as proof that my parcel was delivered  EDIT 2: few people have pointed out that the signature looks like "100" when looked at upside. good catch but the complex I am in has number/letter cominations. the apartment number doesn't look anything like that.
LPT Try to not let it be known that you collect something that's easy for people to obtain. Otherwise for every birthday or Christmas or even just randomly, that thing may be the only type of gift you will receive for the rest of your life.*****Your friends and family will mean well, but it could definitely end up being too much of a good thing. Coming up with gift ideas can be hard. So people will default to what they know you "like."  A friend of my mom's liked clowns and had a small collection of knick knacks. Creepy, I know. Well, for 40 years all she got was clown crap. Constantly. Nobody got her anything that was something _other_ than a clown.   Or, when my wife was young, she liked shopping bags from high end retailers. Who knows why. Before long, she had massive amounts of them. Boxes and boxes of these pointless bags. Friends and family who lived in other parts of the country would send them to her. She got hundreds of them. Eventually, her enthusiasm started to wane. But the bags kept coming. It took a real effort on her part to get people to stop giving them to her.   Not to mention you will end up with multiples of the same gift often.  
LPT: Complete a simple task like making up your bed or preparing an actual breakfast when you wake up in the morning. The feeling of even the smallest accomplishment has been proven to make you more productive during the day.*****
LPT: Addiction to anything is always fun at first and you will never see it until it's too late. Listen to what people around you say even if it's hard.*****
LPT: Learn and practice the HALT and WAIT acronyms when in conversation*****HALT = Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired - if you are in any of these states, understand you are likely going to misinterpret AND BE misinterpreted. best to avoid important conversations.  WAIT = Why am I talking? - are you dominating a conversation? are you trying to appear smart/something? are you being a good listener? etc
LPT: Felt pads used under furniture feet should be checked every once in awhile as they can trap debris (sand, etc) that will scratch your floor even worse.*****
LPT: Windows key + V brings up a Clipboard panel which shows the history of items you’ve copied to the clipboard.*****
LPT: Always be prepared to leave a job, because your employer is always prepared to leave you.*****Do it to advance your career and shield yourself from layoffs.  * Resume is always up to date. * Periodically ask people if they will be your reference. * Go on interviews, even if you don't want the job so you can practice this skill. * Have money saved for in between jobs.
LPT when starting a new job try finding out how long the other employees have worked there*****If all the employees have only been working there for a few weeks/months and there are none that have worked long term the company probably treats workers like shit, doesn't pay on time, doesn't pay right, or otherwise cheats the workers.
LPT: If you're in your 20's and just starting life on your own right now, many habits you start now will be hard to break later if they aren't beneficial for your long term health. .*****Be mindful of the "Yeah but I'll quit/start _____ later," attitude. Thanks
LPT: Try tying in small easy-to-do exercises to everyday tasks, like doing push ups every time you're about to get in the shower. Builds great habits, prompts everyday exercise and adds up quickly.*****I've been doing this for almost a year, and look and feel notably better as a result. I genuinely credit it almost solely with a wide range of positive lifestyle changes and general well-being.
LPT: Teach your dog to relinquish food, toys, etc. willingly (and do it *before* there's an emergency). It might save her life someday and/or save you from getting bitten.*****
LPT: Don't buy a house near a school until you've visited the property at both 8am and 3pm on weekday*****
LPT: If you want to endear someone to you quickly, ask them for advice. Doesn't matter what on; just asking for their opinion on anything shows that you respect them and value their input.*****
LPT Indecision is worse than a bad decision make a decision and make it work.*****In order to move forward with any problem a decision needs to be made. So make it and then work on making your decision work.  Edit: Lots of people disagreeing but just for clarification I am not talking about committing crime or making wildly bad decisions. I mean when faced with a situation that can go two ways chose one and make it work. Which as some have suggested includes reflection and a change of course if necessary. 
LPT: when you're hungry at the airport but unsure of what to eat, check out which spot is favored by flight attendants and flight crew, the more crew at a specific spot the better the place usually is.*****Source: my SO has been a flight attendant for 6 years
LPT: What to do when your partner has a crush*******EDIT: It's been about 3 months since I posted this, and I still get the occasional personal message from someone who is dealing with this stuff and looking for advice. I'm always happy to read your situation and offer my thoughts. I check this account a couple times a week, if not every day.**  Reddit tends to have a black & white view of cheating that I find naive. Crushes tend to walk the line of emotional cheating, but honestly I think they happen in even the most healthy relationships, and **as long as you both want to work through them, they are worth working through.**  My wife and I have dealt with crushes several times over our **10 years** together. Once for me, and twice for her. I swear, if I asked reddit for help during the times she had crushes, cuz it was shitty times, it would have told me to walk away with a couple hundred upvotes, and that would have been the absolute worst advice. We've been married two years now (though we've been devoted to each other for ten years) and could not be happier. Each time has been a chance to make both ourselves and our relationship stronger. So, I decided to share our success with reddit to maybe help other relationships. Obviously you should leave a relationship that is not healthy, but I don't think you should throw away a relationship. (Note: The crushes all happened before we were married).  #What are crushes?  Crushes are accidental feelings someone has for another person (i.e. not their partner). This is different from people who seek out relationships via Tinder, etc. Usually they are with a coworker or classmate, because these are people they bump into a lot. They develop a friendship, and either over time or sometimes quite suddenly, they feel they "hit it off." They might feel the infatuation so strongly, it's like they are in love again. They probably feel confused and incredibly guilty because they love their partner so much, how could they feel such strong emotions for another person? And for you, it must feel like a huge breach of trust. You gave them their heart, how could they?  I think it happens by accident, and it's normal, and it's hard as shit, but as long as you both truly love each other and truly want to get past it, you can. And your relationship will be that much stronger if you do.  #What are the right conditions for a crush to occur?  Crushes happen when there's a perfect storm of variables: **EDIT:** I got some feedback on this so I'd like to change it. ***Crushes can happen at any time in a relationship for a various reasons, though I think the most pervasive crushes occur when there is a perfect storm of variables:***  **1. The relationship is strained** Every relationship goes through hard times. There are ups, and there are downs, and crushes tend to happen when there are downs.  **2. You or your partner's life is strained outside the relationship.** Maybe money is tight. Maybe work is in overdrive. Family is sick. Life really sucks sometimes, and it can make us stressed, which can transfer into our relationship. We are more tense, and show our love less. We might still feel it, it's just harder to show because we're constantly stressed about other things.  **3. The partner is at work/school more than at home awake.** This one is pretty much all the time. We'll be at work or in class more hours in the day than we are at home with our partner. Then he is accidentally spending more time with a coworker or classmate than he is at home. Maybe they share an office, maybe they are in all the same classes. He's not trying to seek her out, they just happen to be in the same place most of the day/week.   **4. The crush represents what you are dissatisfied in with your partner** This might be kind of a cold way to think about it, but relationships can be thought of in terms of Pros & Cons. For example, my wife is not into sci-fi like I am, but this classmate did. We bonded over our favorite Star Trek series, and before I knew it I had a crush. In reality, my wife has a hundred more "pros" than this crush, but this crush had a pro where my wife had a con.  #So, your partner has a crush... What now?  Like I said, my wife and I have dealt with this several times over our relationship, and each time we've set ground rules, and each time we've come out stronger and more in love than before.  **1. Keep open and honest communication at all times, and work through it TOGETHER.** Don't hide your feelings from your partner, even if you want to protect the other person. You might not want to talk about it, wether you have the crush or they do, but you HAVE to communicate. You HAVE to know what your partner is going through at all times. *Work through it together, and you'll come out together.*  **2. Don't be alone with your crush** (like never meet up for coffee), because while she can't avoid working with him, she can avoid seeing him other outside of work. Meeting up like that is a chance at taking intimacy to a deeper level. You might want her to cut off ties to him entirely, but often that's next to impossible to implement. Think of this like a "soft" cutting off ties. Think about it, you have your "work friends," and then you have your "friends you hang out with." It puts a barrier there.  **3. Never complain or joke about your partner to your crush** Even the most innocent joke can indicate you are not happy with your relationship.  **4. Spend more quality time together.** These crushes happen in part because we are at work/school more than we are awake at home. So, overcompensate a little. Turn off the TV, get off facebook & reddit, and play board games or go for walks. I always think the free dates are more intimate than going out to dinner & drinks, because that can feel like throwing money at your relationship, but those can be fun, too.  **5. Don't give ultimatums!!** This is a very common tactic in these situations, and I think it only does harm to the relationship. It might seem like a good test of their devotion to you, but when you are emotional (which you definitely will be if you are going through this), please consider you might not be setting a reasonable ultimatum. More importantly, giving any ultimatum (however reasonable) tells your partner that you value your needs over your relationship. Even more importantly, giving an ultimatum forces them to work on the problem on their own, voiding the chance to work together, which is in violation of rule #1 above and makes it 10x harder to resolve. It says to them, "I give up, it's your problem... fix it or it's over." My parents got married on an ultimatum, so believe me when I tell you it doesn't work the way you think it should. I'm glad they got married and all because I exist and all, but that shit never got resolved.   #Giving an ultimatum ends the relationship, no matter what your partner chooses.  However, in the end, if your partner has a crush, maybe it's not worth it for you to work through their crush. It's a really hard process, and maybe you're not up to the challenge. Maybe you really do value your own needs over this relationship, and wouldn't mind breaking up, which is why you might be tempted to give an ultimatum. But let's be real, that's not because of *their crush*, or anything they did, it's because you don't value the relationship enough to keep working at it when things get tough. And maybe you shouldn't value it, maybe it's a bad relationship and you should give it up, but just be honest about why you're giving up, (and don't give an ultimatum).  These above rules are really simple, and are relatively easy to implement. It's the emotional turmoil the whole thing puts on your relationship that is hard. *Obviously, you need to set your own rules between you and your partner*, I'm just sharing what's worked for us. I hope this helps you if you ever find yourself in one of these not fun situations.  With the first crush, we set these ground rules together, and we've stuck to them, and they've all passed over. We were able to figure out the issues in our own relationships that contributed to crush happening in the first place, and so our relationship is that much stronger.  **EDIT 1:** Thanks for the gold! I can't take all the credit, only half.  **EDIT 2:** Some people have mentioned polyamory as alternatives to my suggestions. Like I said before, these are ground rules we came up with together because it works for both of us, and neither of us are interested in polyamory. If that is something both you and your partner are interested in, you will need to set different ground rules, but other than that it's the same idea: Open & honest communication, deep respect for your partner, and not breaking the ground rules, whatever you set. The same goes for threesomes and open relationships.  **EDIT 3:** To those "alphas" calling me beta-as-fuck, that I'm emasculating/compromising myself, that I can't keep my woman in line, etc.... This is advice for a healthy relationship. Healthy relationships are built on open communication of feelings, and respect for your partner. If you feel like you should control your woman in order to keep her from looking at other men, then that is not a healthy relationship, it's a controlling one. And if someone is in a controlling relationship, chances are they are unhappy, and if they are unhappy, chances are they will be looking for another, healthier relationship. In effect, you are creating a situation that encourages cheating.   And regarding me being "beta-as-fuck" I don't even consider that an insult. "Alphas," as I understand it, view women as objects to be controlled and used to meet the Alpha's own needs. If you want to insult me, call me an alpha (though that would be undeniably off base in the first place)
LPT: Always copy any text you have input on any online web form before you click submit. If the page fails to load you can still save your work*****As a backup, after copying, paste into a text file... this happened to me years back in Windows 98 days on dial up... I spent 2 hours typing a job application only to click submit and my connection had dropped... never did it again after that!
LPT: Keep extra napkins in your car's glove compartment. You won't believe how many times they'll get you out of a jam.*****
LPT: you can use @gmail.com and @googlemail.com interchangeably. Perfect for signing up to a website twice without setting up two accounts.*****Both email addresses resolve to the same account.  Edit: wooooo front page 
LPT: If you're buying a car from a dealership and know exactly what you want, tell the dealer you're torn between that and another car, but leaning towards the other car. The dealer, wanting to close the deal, will reveal the negative aspects of the car you actually want to get.*****This will let you know exactly what you're getting. 
LPT: You can turn off Reddit’s new, annoying ‘trending posts’ notifications by going to Settings > Notifications, and turning ‘Trending Posts’ off.*****
LPT: If someone wishes you Merry Christmas and you don't celebrate Christmas, just say thank you. There's no need to tell them you don't celebrate. It just makes things awkward*****
LPT: if you’re a manager/supervisor of any kind, say “thank you” to your team every once in a while, even if it’s non-specific. Even the smallest amount of thanks/appreciation goes a long way to boost workplace morale*****Edit: everyone saying they want a raise - you earn more money by doing work at a level above what is expected and *earning* more money. It’s not just handed to you for doing what you’re expected to do anyway.   A “thank you” from a manager is acknowledgment that you’re being a productive member of the team, moving the team towards its goal. If you’ve never worked in an environment where managers don’t say “thank you,” you’re lucky. It makes tedious work even more soul-crushing
LPT:‘Swallow the frog’: Do the thing you are least looking forward to first and the whole day will seem brighter and easier.*****
LPT If you accidentally dial 911, follow through with the call.*****You may panic and not say anything, then maybe hang up.  You aren't in trouble and you'll actually waste *more* of the operator's time by hanging up, because then they have to call you back to make sure there was no emergency.    
LPT: If someone in your group of friends is generally the go to person for advice or to vent to, please take time to ask them if they're ok. Even if they always seem positive/upbeat.*****If they're anything like me, they are really good at putting on a happy face and are not good at asking for help when they need it. This has been a really rough month and I realized today that I'm really good at hiding that fact. Someone just complimented me on always being so positive, though right now on the inside I feel like I'm drowning in sorrow.  Edit: Wow, this really blew up, I really did not expect that. I sincerely appreciate everyone who responded, reading through these has eased my mind a bit. Also thank you kind stranger for my first reddit gold!   To those of you who asked if I'm ok; Tbh not really but I will be. The darkness in my mind waxes and wanes and yesterday was a bit heavier than I'm used to, probably due to pain that's been keeping me from sleeping well the past month. I'm working on getting better at asking for help and expressing how I truly feel all the time, not just when I'm happy. I'd explain more of what I'm going through but I have a hard enough time doing that with friends, as this post has gotten much more attention than I was expecting I'll just say that I'm working on getting better one day at a time.   Again thank you all, none of you are truly alone in this. Be kind to one another and yourselves. ~~Even~~  Especially the ones that seem mean spirited or grumpy, they often are just projecting and need it just a much.  I'm at work now so I'll try to respond to as many of you as I can this evening. Most likely through your inbox.
LPT: If you have a kid in team sports like hockey where they’re in full gear, get them distinctly coloured gloves. They’ll be much easier to spot when they’re speeding down the ice and you can’t see their number.*****
LPT: Instead of saying 'Sorry this is late', say 'Thanks for your patience.' Using positive language in a negative situation can have a big impact on how you're remembered.*****
LPT: Always correct someone privately and one-on-one rather in a group setting. It will save them humiliation and they will have greater respect for you.*****
LPT: If you ever spill laundry detergent, try cleaning it up first with laundry you already need to wash*****
LPT: If you're not planning to do anything the entire day, go outside for a walk.*****THEN you can go shower and not feel like you wasted a day :D  Edit: Wow this post blew up all over the place  Edoot 2: haha relax guys is just joke yes?  Edota 3: Thanks for the gold kind stranger  Actual real edit this time:  How the fuck do so many of you claim to not have ONE fucking day where you don't have anything planned that you MUST DO? Live a little for crying out loud. Doing nothing productive is good sometimes. And I mean, if you take so much pleasure in having your life sectioned into doing so many things on your days off, good for you, but don't bring your negativity unto people who enjoy the pleasure of looking at the fucking sky all day and think about nothing
LPT: If you're trying to improve, and you know you're gonna relapse, write a note to yourself saying why you shouldn't, and why you want to improve. Whenever you feel like you're gonna fall back, read the note.*****
LPT: Overspend at places like Starbucks each month? Decide on the monthly budget you want for yourself and buy a gift card for that amount. Once it’s out, it’s done and force yourself to wait until next month to get another.*****
As of 10/6/19, LPT will now be implementing a NO TIP COPYING policy. Word for Word tips that are copied from older posts or near identical posts will no longer be permitted. We have one request with your tips: BE ORIGINAL.*****Please see the new rule #10. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in this thread, or send us a message. We'll clear things up.  Thank you, stay awesome.
LPT: after a family member gets married, keep the list of things that they registered for but didn’t get and use it for birthday and Christmas presents. It will save you time wondering what they want especially if they’re difficult to shop for.*****
LPT: Funky smell in the basement? If there's drains, pour a bucket of water down them to keep the trap full.*****
LPT: Need something done? Call legal*****TL/DR: Can't get a corporation to do their job? Call their legal department and ask/tell them about their liability.  Story: The cable/internet provider's underground junction box on my corner had a broken latch, making the cover not sit correctly on the box. It's a big junction box, about 2'x4', and the kids who gather at the bus stop there were always playing with it and leaving it ajar. I wanted it fixed because (a) didn't want some kid getting hurt, and (b) eventually something would break and I'd lose my internet.  I called the customer service line several times and nothing got done.  So I called the corporate main number and asked for legal. Person asked how to direct my call and I told them I wanted to ask someone about their liability for injuries caused by their equipment.  Got a lawyer on the phone and told them about the situation, and that I was sure they would want to fix it ASAP because "if a child gets hurt there I'm sure you don't want that liability falling on you." Made sure to ask for their name, title, email address, and direct phone line and to mention that I would email my notes from our conversation to them, and would welcome any comments/corrections if I missed anything.  Cover was replaced within 90 minutes.
LPT: The fjrst time you give someone flowers, do it randomly. Don't wait for a special occasion.*****The random act of giving flowers can mean so much more than when they're expected.
LPT: dental floss works in the place of sewing thread for jobs where color matching isn't necessary. Floss is extremely strong and works well for leather and repairs where strength is needed. To tie off a seam, tie multiple end knots and add a tiny drop of super glue to that knot. Crazy strong.*****
LPT Practice now before it's too late-Set off your smoke alarm and call your pets, give them a treat. When the smoke alarm does go off, with your practice, they will come running when you call them saving your time and life looking for them if there is a real fire.*****I've been practicing this by putting a candle up to our smoke alarm. Hopefully, I will never need to really use this.
LPT: Don't buy your textbooks for school before you go to class. Wait for the professor to go over the syllabus to see if the textbook is actually required and it can potentially save you hundreds of dollars.*****I've been doing this since I started college and it's saved me $500+   This semester alone I saved $200 from not buying 2 textbooks that weren't mandatory
LPT: You can ask any company to produce or delete any data they have on you directly from the footer of their website by clicking "Do Not Sell My Personal Information." This link is required by law under the new CCPA.*****The CCPA is the California Consumer Privacy Act. Like the European GDPR that came before it, it guarantees certain individuals rights around the use and sale of their data. More specifically, California residents can force companies to produce any data they have on them, and delete it on request.   By law, these companies must follow through with deletion, **and reach out to any 3rd parties** to whom they sold the data, and have them delete it as well.  As an example, here's [Vizio's website](https://www.vizio.com/en/home). You'll see that "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" is listed in the footer. This specific language is required by law.  **If you don't live in California, you can still benefit from this law**. It's too expensive and resource intensive to figure out where a person lives and see whether the law applies to them, so companies are adhering to most requests regardless. Companies are rightly assuming that more states will enact such laws, so it's not worth splitting hairs over where you live.  The CCPA went into effect on 1/1/2020, so the footer links are starting to go live on many sites. By mid-year, enforcement begins, and you will have the ability to sue any company that fails to comply.  EDIT: LOTS of people asking about Facebook. Their footer link isn't published yet, but here's a direct link from a Google search: https://m.facebook.com/help/contact/784491318687824  EDIT 2: Please be careful when doing this. If you're using a service, and you want to keep that service, deleting your data might mean deleting your account. Some companies have data on you without an account, which is where this is very effective  EDIT 3: Yes, this is for California residents. Yes, some companies will ask where you reside. Some companies will not, because they know more and more states will enact legislation. It's coming, so it's good for business to honor it more broadly. So even if you're not from CA, in many cases you CAN use this for yourself, no questions asked.
LPT: When buying tickets for a sporting event for a large amount of people, buy some of the tickets in the row behind.*****There's nothing worse than being a member of an 8 person social event and being stuck on one end of a row. You never get to speak with the people at the other end. Buying 4 seats in front of 4 seats for example, makes it easier for everyone to talk to each other.  Edit:  Okay, yes.  It should be a large number of people, not large amount of people.  I know it was completely unintelligible before.
Give special consideration to the advice when "laid back" friends tell you not to do something risky, or when more "uptight" and cautious friends tell you to take a chance.*****EDIT:  Phrasing could've been better. Perhaps instead of "laid back" I should have written "wild" or something similar.
LPT - You can see if your ice cream carton has been tampered with by how easily the lid comes off. The cartons are “hardened” in freezers upside-down, so the ice cream sticks to the lid. You should have to tug the lid off the first time. If it comes off too easily, that’s evidence of tampering.*****Edit: some brands come with tamper-evident packaging, either a cellophane ring around the lid or a film under the lid. **But many do not**, that natural seal formed by the ice cream hardening against the lid is what they rely on.  Edit 2: okay so to address a common comment here, no, the ice cream softening while being transported from truck to store case or from the store to your house won’t unstick the lid. Even slightly softened the ice cream stays “tacky” and adheres to the lid until it goes back in the freezer and firms up again.   This form of packaging is just as “tamper evident” as a ring around the lid or a film under the lid. It does have a safety seal. The ice cream IS the seal.   No, once you really pull lid off, you can’t stick it back on with your spit. It takes softened ice cream pressing right up against the lid then going in a special hardening freezer at about -30F to form the seal. Once you break it, it’s very hard to reproduce.  Edit 3: no, you don’t have to pull the lid off to check if it’s sealed. Just give it a slight tug, you’ll be able to tell it’s secure. If it actually comes off, it was never sealed to begin with.
LPT: Before arguing about religion/politics/sports, ask yourselves if anything would ever make either of you change your position. If either of you answer no, just agree to disagree—even the world's best table tennis player can't beat a wall.*****
LPT: If you have a loved one in an assisted living center, send them a card every once in a while. Just a few minutes of your time will mean the world to them.*****
LPT: If your company offers 401k matching, do it. That's an instant 100% return on investment. That's better than any stock, bond, mutual fund, etc in existence.*****
LPT: Showing someone 'reflective appreciation' for something they did for you earlier that day means more them than it did when you said 'thank you' as it happened.*****E.g. If a friend gives you a ride home, I am sure you say 'thank you' as you leave the car. Before you go to bed that night send them a message telling them how much you appreciate what they did and how thankful you were for it.  Everytime you said 'thank you' to a friend, you should show them 'reflective appreciation' later.  EDIT UPDATE : Wooow. I had no idea this would get so many upvotes and comments. Despite the fact I missed out words and had several typos on my post I am glad to see that so many people have taken from it what I intended.   A key phrase is 'catch them doing it right'. Let's be positive and show appreciation and love.
LPT: If an ambulance is called for you, you do not have to ride in it. If you choose to exercise your right to refuse treatment & transport, they will have you sign a form with a witness saying so. TAKE A PICTURE OF THIS FORM to protect yourself from getting billed. (U.S.A.)*****I saw [this meme](https://i.imgur.com/Q7EpWAf.png) circulating just now on facebook. As a medical professional, I realize there are a lot of misconceptions in the general public about medical care in the US. The first one this runs into: just because an ambulance is called for you doesn't mean you have to ride in it, except in very specific exceptions (for example, if you are a minor with obvious injury and no parent present, or if you are inebriated by drugs/alcohol). As a mentally competent adult, you have the legal right to refuse treatment and transport via an ambulance, so if you don't want to receive treatment or ride to the hospital (ambulance bills are expensive, especially out of network), just say so (competent medics will *always* strongly recommend that you do, because it opens us up to liability if we don't- it doesn't necessarily mean we think you need it). But we can't force you to come with us. Know your rights.   If you state you do not want to be transported or treated (and you can refuse either or both, it's up to you), the medics will have you sign paperwork stating that you are refusing treatment or transport, and will usually have a witness sign it too. This form is for their protection, not yours, but it's a double edged sword: it can be used to prove that you did not receive treatment in the (unfortunately likely) event that the ambulance company tries to bill you anyway. Ask for a copy and if they can't give you one (usually they're on carbon paper, but not always) take a picture with your phone. This document is going to be your holy grail if they try to bill you erroneously- Having proof of it could save you thousands of dollars.  
LPT: How to lace your running shoes*****
LPT: Start 2017 off with an empty jar and fill it with notes of good things that happen. On New Year's Eve, empty it and see what awesome stuff happened that year.*****Also check the reposts from [2016,](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/3y01v7/lpt_start_2016_off_with_an_empty_jar_and_fill_it/) [2015,](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/2q1dam/lpt_start_2015_off_with_an_empty_jar_and_fill_it/) [2014,](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1tn05k/lpt_start_2014_off_with_an_empty_jar_and_fill_it/) and the original from [2013](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/13r2af/start_2013_off_with_an_empty_jar_and_fill_it_with/) for more ideas.

LPT: If you are putting air in your tires, put some air in your spare tire as well. Some spare tires will lose air over time and you never know when you’ll need to use it.*****
LPT: when you want to buy something but don’t actually need it, put it off until your next pay check. The wait will teach you how much you want it, and help you avoid overspending.*****
LPT: if you're buying a car from a dealership, do NOT buy it on your first visit no-matter-what*****The car dealership business revolves around getting people to make quick, rash decisions while their being glared at by a sales rep and a finance manager. Do NOT make a decision to purchase on your first visit. Absolutely demand to go home and sleep on it. This also has the added benefit of putting pressure on the sales rep to come up with some other incentive to get you to come back, that you might have missed out on by just buying on the first visit.
LPT: If you only need to withdraw $10-$20, a $0.99 ice tea at a convenience store is cheaper than most ATM fees.*****Most ATMs that are not owned by your bank charge a $2-4 fee. Buying something small at a convenience store and asking for cash back will often save you a few dollars. Bonus: A refreshing ice tea is your reward for saving money. 
LPT: People want someone to tell them what to do in emergency situations. For example while performing CPR on someone don't say "Someone call an ambulance" instead talk to one person and ask him/her to call an ambulance directly.*****
LPT: If you are having a stressful day or period of life, keeping your apartment clean and personal belongings well organized must be your top priority.*****My life has been a disaster zone for a while. Everyday is a huge stress, which makes me a sort of expert in stress management. In times like that, even minor hiccups in your daily routine can derail your very fragile balance and sanity.  You may remember from your own experience how easily you can become unreasonably aggressive if you haven't been able to find something in your room for half an hour while being in a big hurry. Things like that, when thrown on top of the already present stress from a complicated life situation, can make you behave unreasonably and aggravate everything even more. Nobody knows how it's going to end, but you will unlikely benefit from it.   Small things matter. That's where everything starts. The butterfly effect in action.   PS: Just finished cleaning my apartment. Feel much better and can think more clearly now.         
LPT: If you are more able and want to give your seat up to an elderly person/woman on public transportation, physically get up and offer them your seat instead of staying seated and asking. They are much more likely to accept your offer if the seat is physically open.*****
LPT: Take the doors off fridges when moving/installing them. It makes them immensely lighter and more maneuverable.*****Edit 1: since people are getting technical about things here. You can also use an appliance cart or air sled. I was just trying to give an easy tip that could be done with a screwdriver.  Edit 2: the side by side’s we’d sell were 450 lbs of long, tall, and wide machine. One of the doors would have a built-in ice maker and electronics inside it. That door was easily 50 lbs if not more by itself. Then, you still have the other side door and the bottom freezer door. Removing the doors made it close to 100 lbs lighter. No, even with a standard dolly, I can’t move 450 lbs up and down stairs without damaging property. Plus, you can keep the doors from being damaged by moving them separately.   Edit 3: I don’t know if this voids the warranty. I just installed and repaired the appliances. However, we’d do this to almost every new fridge we’d deliver. There was never a problem with the manufacturer and I don’t even know how they’d know it was done. I mean it’s just screws for the doors and hinges and clips for the waterline and electronic line. There wasn’t any tape or any type of system to show that the doors had been tampered with.   Edit 4: if your fridge has water and electronic lines running through the door, unclip the lines 1st before unscrewing that door.   Edit 5: all contractors out there. Can you not install those super tiny really high hard to reach cabinets over the fridge space. No one really uses them and the fridges are only getting taller. We would either have to rip them out or have the client buy a smaller model. 
LPT: If you lock your keys in your car, don't call a locksmith, call a towing company. They will typically unlock your car for less than a locksmith, arrive faster, and are available 24/7*****
LPT: If you’re listening to something with one earbud on, turn on Mono Audio. This allows you to here ALL sound through one earbud. This is especially helpful with music.*****Hear*
LPT: if you're trying to choose the fastest line between many similarly long lines at an amusement park/airport customs/stadium/etc, choose the line with the most children. Groups with children usually go through as one transaction so the line will move faster.*****
LPT: When in an argument, pretend like you're being recorded. This will prevent you from saying stupid/mean things you may regret later.*****Edit: I never thought I'd get to say this, but RIP inbox!! This blew up way more than I could ever imagine, hopefully the advice helps  Edit2: Thanks for the Reddit Gold!
LPT: If your friend suddenly starts acting shady or distant from you for no apparent reason check up on them to make sure they are ok. Sometimes people need people to check up on them, but don’t want to seem needy.*****
LPT: Whenever you make eye contact with someone randomly, just smile! They'll most likely smile back and that just makes the world a little bit happier. :)*****
LPT: To always know out whether to say “Billy and I” or “Billy and me”, remove the “Billy and” portion and say your sentence to see if it sounds right. “Billy and I went to the store” bc had Billy not been there, I went. Not Me went.*****Edit: obviously my grammar isn't that great by how i added an extra word in the beginning! You get the idea!
LPT: Spend a day looking through all the online stuff you Favorited and forgot. You'd be blown away by how much interesting and useful stuff is in there.*****
LPT: On a long car ride, stand-up comedy albums (found on Apple Music or Spotify) can make time pass by quicker than actual music.*****
LPT: When a product breaks or malfunctions, even if it’s out of warranty or it’s your fault, don’t just throw it away. Contact the company and let them know that you love the product and ask if there are any options to replace it. Frequently, they will either offer a discount or a free replacement.*****EDIT: People keep asking for examples, here are a few that come to mind, but there are many, many more. I may add more as I think of them. Here are a few companies that have taken care of me outside of warranty for items over $100, and only one I asked for it for free (Chevy out-of-warranty repair).   * Nordstrom: jeans that split in the seams after about a year they replaced no questions asked.  * Apple: replaced two iPhones over the course of 3-4 years outside of Apple Care that were malfunctioning after I broke the screen. Never asked for free phone. Went in for screen fix, they just replaced entire phone free.  * Apple: 2015 MacBook Pro having random issues. They thought it was the battery / fan assembly and charged me $220 to replace, but said it could be the logic board. If Logic Board, I would pay the difference ($550 minus $220). They even gave me a written quote. Found out after another month it was the Logic Board, but when I brought back in, they offered to replace the Logic board free for the inconvenience of bringing in a second time, and I never even suggested getting a discount on it or acted inconvenienced. Just being friendly with the staff.  * Kühl clothing: had a $250 puffy winter jacket, picked up a hot soup pan and melted it clean through. Composed a very funny email and picture documenting and sent to them and asked if I could pay to have it repaired since I’m such a klutz and melted it. Instead, they immediately sent me a brand new jacket. I didn’t even pay for shipping.  * Chevy: new-ish car at 40k miles or so. Needed expensive out-of-warranty repair after my car had already spent 3 weeks in the shop a few months earlier. I did ask for this one, because it was so close to the warranty period still and I wasn’t terribly happy with the reliability record of the car. They obliged.  * Rode microphones: Shockmount for a professional microphone broke. I called customer service to order a new one (3-4 year old product), and saw they were $50 on the website. Just told him it broke and I wanted to order a replacement part, instead they just offered to send a replacement free of charge. Didn’t even pay shipping.  * Verizon Wireless: broke screen on iPhone X, called customer service to see if I had the device protection (thought I did). Didn’t ask for anything free, just asked her if there were any options available, the rep said she’d gladly split the cost of the repair with me and promptly credited my account for $137.50 right on the same phone call.  * Blinds company (?): found receipt, limited warranty, I admitted having to pull them down hard to get them to close, possibly being responsible for the damage. I paid shipping to send them in, they repaired for free.
LPT: Use "C.A.R" or "S.T.A.R" in Job applications & Interviews*****[This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/5m9zwd/i_got_a_job_interview/) inspired me to post this tip...  [Edit](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/5mk342/lpt_use_car_or_star_in_job_applications_interviews/dc4f5wo/):  [CAR](https://www.bluesteps.com/blog/car-interview-technique-key-to-landing-executive-job.aspx)  Car is Context, Action, Result   [STAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_Task,_Action,_Result)  Star is Situation, Task, Action, Result.  ---  When applying for jobs, you **need** to give examples if you can; it's alright saying "I would do ..." but it's much better to say "I did ...".  Using this technique, I went from never hearing back from job applications to being inundated with replies and offers...Albeit "starter jobs" but you've got to start somewhere...  I'm not saying this is a magical one-stop-solution, but it may help.  Question: "How would you deal with conflict resolution?"  Answer:  Context: "Working as a front desk receptionist, I recall a time where a customer came in really aggressive and angry because his money was stopped"  Action: "I looked into the situation, and found that he needed to provide xyz, and explained how to do so"  Result: "customer left happy, came back with the documents and was happy knowing his payment would be resumed".   This works just as well in applications, as the interview itself.   ---  Edit 2:  Wow this really blew up ...  I'm glad this has helped a few, and even got some the job...[At google no less!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/5mk342/lpt_use_car_or_star_in_job_applications_interviews/dc4iwk8/?context=3)  I have been silently reading your comments, and there are loads of variants to these acronyms/phonemes(?) Whilst it [may not suit all](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/5mk342/lpt_use_car_or_star_in_job_applications_interviews/dc4isb2/?context=3) it's quite interesting to see how vast it can mean in other applications. 
LPT: When browsing en.wikipedia.org, you can replace "en" with "simple" to bring up simple English wikipedia, where everything is explained like you're five.*****simple.wikipedia.org
LPT: If you approach a group of ATM machines and all but 1 is messy and unkempt, be careful using the only "clean" one. Thieves looking to skim your card will make other ATMs look unappealing so you'll use the 1 they have rigged.*****This was something I learned during security training for a previous job I had. It's actually a thing. 
LPT: Saying cheese in a photo makes people have lame smiles, words that end in "a" works way better, and give natural smiles.*****A trick I use for group photos is to loudly announce this before taking a photo and then use the example word "vagina" everyone laughs. click.   FP edit: holy shit! I made it to the front page! Send... ummm... money to charity.  water4.org is a good one. 
LPT: If you struggle to wake up and get moving in the morning, buy a stress ball or grip strengthener*****I have chronic anemia and ever since I was a little kid, I have never known the feeling of "waking up rested". Friends of mine describe waking up and immediately having the energy to jump out of bed. It is always a slow crawl for me to eventually muster the energy and drag myself out.  Last week I bought a grip strength trainer to strengthen my hands and left it on my nightstand. This morning, in my stupor, I decided to put a few rounds into it half-asleep. To my great surprise, I was wide away within 10-15 minutes from this simple act of exertion getting the blood flowing.   Try it!! It's brainless and all you do is squeeze your hand a bit which pretty much anyone should be able to do! A stress ball should also prove to be an effective alternative  Edit: A couple of things to add, the anemia in question is a genetic mutation called thalassemia. It is the result of a blood mutation that causes my hemoglobin to decompose at an abnormal rate, thus hindering my blood's ability to deliver oxygen to the rest of my body.  While this was the first time I tried this, I posted to LPT because the effect was SO noticeable over everything else I've done to try and alleviate the morning fatigue. Memory foam mattress, getting to sleep earlier, morning wank, sleeping pills, melatonin, all these had a marginal effect if any at all. But today, BAM. I was up and moving around with no issues at all. I'll continue to trial this and keep you posted. I hope that others have success with this tip!
LPT If your pencil sharpener isn’t sharpening to a point anymore tighten the screw on the blade*****
LPT: If you own a vehicle. Please, be extremely mindful of your tire air pressures.*****I worked in the automotive industry for over 5 years. I have encountered too many people whom are unaware of how important proper tire air pressure is. The tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) in your vehicle is an aid to this matter. It is only there to let you know about drastic differences in air pressure between your tires. We have to remember that the tires on our vehicles are what dictate how well we will be able to handle said vehicle. Tires are what make contact with the road, thus should be the forefront of our safety priorities. Rather not have to use your seatbelt because you were able to brake in time, than total your vehicle due to an over inflated tire.  Yes, i said that correctly, over inflated. When we over inflate our tires, we decrease the surface area that makes contact with the road. In turn, reducing friction between the tire and road. This increases our distance to come to a stop, and how much under/over steer we experience. Over inflated tires are also more suceptable to blow outs due to the already high pressure. Over inflated tires suffer decreased life time, dangerous cracking, and decreased traction.  Under inflated tires are just as dangerous. We are more attentive to a low pressure tire because they are more visible. Severely under inflated tires can unseat from the bead, causing you to possibly lose control of your vehicle. Pot holes and bumps on the road can possibly pinch the wall of a low pressure tire, causing you to lose said tire. Decreased gas mileage is also an effect of under inflated tires. When a tire is under inflated, it does not have enough pressure to keep proper shape, thus "folding" under the vehicle when moving. This increase how much torque must be applied for said tires to rotate.   Most vehicles, on the drivers door jamb, have a tire pressure information sticker. If we follow those guidelines, we will all be safer on the roads. If you find your tires to be incorrectly inflated, once corrected, you will immediately feel the difference. Gas mileage depends on how you drive but, your tires will always have an effect. Please, be safe on the roads. We already have to deal with enough to have to go through something that could of been avoided by properly inflated tires. Lets all be safe on the roads!  Edit: Space. Than.
LPT: When downloading a PDF on Chrome that you only need a few pages of, use the Print option instead of the Save option. Print has a “Save to PDF” mode, and allows you to select only the relevant pages.*****Edit: First, to everybody saying that this converts the file to an image - thanks, I didn’t know this! Second, if you’re asking why one would do this, sometimes you need to send one page of a document to someone and don’t want to go through the process of downloading, finding a website to extract a page, reuploading, processing, then redownloading. Or downloading a massive PDF splitting program so you can split your one file.
LPT: Place tape over your laptop's mic and camera to reduce what the CIA can monitor.*****Even Mark Zuckerberg uses this LPT 
LPT: If you already know what gifts you're getting people for the upcoming holidays, put it in an online cart now but don't buy it yet. Most places will send you coupons or special promotions to try and get you to buy the product.*****Edit: This is not for every website or product ever, if you only shop on large retailers you're probably missing out. Some companies do it and others do not. It's definitely worth it to save a few bucks if you're going to buy it anyway.
LPT: Whenever you are happy or proud of yourself write it down on your phone. A lot of times these memories are lost forever. This habit can be a new source of happiness for you. It is essentially increases and prolongs the amount of happiness you receive from a given moment.*****EDIT: I realized a lot of my notes are things that happened that I appreciate. I think this is great because I started to recognize positive things from situations I would take for granted  This has always helped me when I was down. Suffering depression since I was 15, reading my list of notes really brought me out of a ditch when I was down
LPT: if you get mail delivered that’s already been opened, report it to the postal inspector*****There’s lots of holiday cards being sent through the mail this time of year. They are easy to spot since they’re usually a very distinct shape and size. Many times these cards will have checks or cash in them, making them really easy targets for mail theft.   It’s clearly easy to track who cashed a stolen check, but not so much with cash.   If your mail is arriving opened and things are missing, report it. There is a special postal inspection service specifically for this type of thing. You can report online or over the phone.   [Here is the link to their site. ](https://postalinspectors.uspis.gov/)  I called them today to report this exact issue and was routed to a real, live person very quickly AND they were courteous and very helpful. Took all pertinent information and confirmed it and let me know I would be contacted in the next 2-3 business days.  It was all very efficient and easy.   Suggest to family members and people that might send cash in a card to, instead, send a check (since they’re easier to track, can do stop payments if necessary). If they must send cash, have them send in a standard sized security envelope (the kind that have some type of pattern on the inside to make them less transparent), or in a standard sized not security envelope, but wrapped in a piece of lined paper or two so it isn’t readily apparent what’s inside.    **edit:** wow, this got popular!    * Because there may be some confusion, reporting to your post office, is not the same as reporting to the postal inspector.  * I posted this because I have recently had my mail arrive deliberately opened.  And I mean, the envelope was sealed with packing tape that had been sliced through, presumably with a knife-like object.    * I am in the US, but from the comments, it looks like the UK has something similar for their mail.  A quick Google search looked to have some good resources.  * There's a lot of folks saying nothing will happen, and that may be the case, but from reading the web site, it looks like they determine whether to investigate based on trends and number of reports.  If several people in a neighborhood are being affected, maybe try getting everyone to call in and report the issue so the inspectors don't write it off to "the mail machine probably tore up the envelope."  * If you can tell me how to get rid of the picture, I would be happy to.  When I added the link to the inspector's site, I guess Reddit decided to pick a picture of one of their most wanted.  
LPT: When you have a laptop for college, make sure you make two accounts. One for studying and one for all other things.*****A clean desktop and lack of games (you can remove them per user) can really limit distractions. Put a website blocker on the browser of the account for studying, this will prevent you even more from procrastinating.    Taking this to the extreme: bonus points for everyone who dualboots Windows and Linux or uses VMs!  If you found the above too extreme, you can also try [multiple virtual desktops in Windows 10](http://www.howtogeek.com/197625/how-to-use-virtual-desktops-in-windows-10/) as some of you have suggested.  **Edit:** This could also apply to a work environment, call it a presentation account.  **Edit 2:** If you have a Mac, download the *SelfControl* app. You can block any sites that you mindlessly type in when you are trying to distract yourself from studying. /u/glazzies  **Edit 3:** Use *leechblock* to block websites on Firefox and *StayFocusd* on Chrome.
LPT: If you have a dashcam, keep a second memory card in your car. That way in the event of an accident, you can swap out the card to help protect the footage. Secondly, it allows you to have a backup if you main card fails while you are out and about.*****
LPT: On vacation? Don't eat anywhere near tourist spots. The food is rarely authentic and twice as expensive. Walk a few blocks away, usually about where there aren't anymore signs subtitled in English, then eat there.*****I used to work at Rockefeller Center in NYC and had to walk away from the tourist trap every day to eat good food at a reasonable price. Took that lesson with me to Rome, Italy. Instead of eating next the tourist spots (Palatine Hill, the Colosseum, Spanish Steps, etc), we'd always walk a few blocks away to where people stopped speaking English. Food was waaay better than the obviously frozen pasta we had our first day, before I realized what we should've been doing.    Edit: As with any LPT, context matters.  In some countries, it's better and safer to stay within the tourist bubble.
LPT: For those without home security alarms...if you have a car with a keyless entry remote, leave it next to your bed. If someone tries to break into your house, press the panic button. Your car's alarm will go off, which will draw attention to your house or scare whoever is trying to break in.*****Poor man's home security system.   EDIT: Yes, guns work better. Not everyone can get them though.  EDIT2: It's true that no one cares about car alarms, but it will likely startle whoever is breaking in, and people generally hate loud car alarms.  
LPT: When microwaving leftover rice put a glass of water next to it. It will allow the rice to be softer.*****
LPT; Occasionally walk up to your immediate supervisor and ask for some constructive criticism. Be specific by asking something like "What could I have done better on the Penske files?". Whatever they say, just respond thank you and walk away.*****Once I learned this after being  a defensive person, it freed me from so much anxiety. I initiate the criticism, I take in the info and walk away. Now I hope this manger won't have an issue with coaching me in fear of being an excuse maker. And they will know I am open to growth . The latter part of my career went much better by doing this.    **EDIT** To be clear a couple of key things.   * This will not work with POS managers that are the worst to work with. They don't care, they will not be promoted and if they stick around with that company, it is an indictment of the company's over all culture and you should start looking for a better employer.  * If this type of behaviour is not in your repertoire **but** you really want to be a better employee, bring this up after your next review or privately that you are looking to change your ways. If it is not sincere don't waste everyone's time in my opinion.   **EDIT 2** Thanks everyone. This was one of those posts I expected to get buried in a matter of moments. Thank you for letting me share my perspective. 
LPT: When cleaning your windows clean the inside vertically and outside horizontally. That way if there are streaks you know which side of the glass they're on.*****
LPT: keep a big jug next to your kitchen sink. When you turn the hot water on and are waiting for it to get hot, fill the jug instead of wasting down the drain. Use it to drink or water a plant.*****Edit- wow my first front page!   Edit 2-  I didn't upvote this or put it on the front page, you did so if you think it's a shit idea, don't do it. 
LPT: If you have lettuce that is wilted/soft, leave it in a sink full of water overnight. This is what Grocery stores do to make it crisp & fresh!*****Edit 2: USE A BOWL OR A BUCKET...  *** It’s important to add that we soaked overnight only when very wilted(think wet paper)   Like those in the comments, it’s best practice to do a short soak in a bowl of *cold* water for an hour & than place it in your crisper bin in the fridge.  Edit 1: This was in a produce-department ONLY sink, which was used purely for washing &amp; prep of vegetables.   My apologies for some confusion, I wrote this in class
LPT: When posting your resume online for a specific job, copy the “looking for” section and paste in white font at bottom of your resume. You place higher because you’re a “perfect match” and humans won’t notice when they read it.*****
LPT: In Chrome's address bar, type "slide", "doc", or "sheet" followed by ".new" to instantly create and go to a new document.*****EDIT: Works in any browser.  Type for instance "[slide.new](https://slide.new)" into the omnibar and it will make a new Google Slides presentation stored in your Google Drive.  GIF to demo: [https://twitter.com/googledocs/status/1055490445088903168](https://twitter.com/googledocs/status/1055490445088903168)
LPT Take at least one good Statistics course while you're in college. For most professions, it's by the far the most useful math discipline.*****Unless you're an engineer, statistics is probably going to be the most useful math discipline you'll take.  You'll never use Calculus or Geometry, but statistics comes up all the time, and most people don't understand even basics like the difference between median and mean.  In business, a solid foundation in basic statistics comes in very handy quite often.  Most other math we're forced to learn in school, not so much. 
If you are ever in a situation where you have to apologize. Give one heartfelt apology and move on. Repeatedly apologizing will only make it worse.*****
LPT: the more alarms you set, the more likely you are to oversleep because you get used to turning them off while half-awake. Train yourself to wake up to one or two alarms only with no snooze.*****Edit: thank you for the gold, kind stranger! I hope everyone gets a good night's sleep!
LPT: Train your puppy to ring a bell you hang by the door so he/she can let you know audibly when they need to go outside.*****I've done this with each of my dogs and it has worked wonderfully. It gives them a chance to audibly ask to go outside even when I'm not near the door. This in turn prevents scratching at the door (which can cause damage) and helps prevent accidents earlier on in life when potty training.  **Edit: Had requests about how to train this. Here's how:**  It's all about the treats and praise! What I do is I start by ringing the bell and giving a treat. I do this for a while until I notice the dog has associated the sound with receiving a treat (they'll lick lips or run over to the bell or something similar once they get it).  Then I'll ring the bell but make them go outside to get the treat (training them that bell rings, then you go outside, then you get a treat).  Then I'll take their paw or snout and physically make them touch the bell. Then we go outside and they get a treat.   Eventually they'll connect the dots. Bell = outside. Treats can be withdrawn as outside is a reward in and of itself (running in the yard, peeing, chasing a squirrel, etc).   It hasn't taken me long - just a couple days with even a few month old puppy. They learn fast!
LPT: If the emotional reaction of the person you're talking to seems out of proportion to the situation, they're probably upset about something other than the current topic of conversation.*****
LPT: Tired of getting the wrong size shoe because it's not the same number brand to brand. Learn your EUR shoe size. It's more accurate than USA shoe sizes.*****I get USA shoe size range from 9-10. But if I stick with my EUR size of 43, I never get the wrong size no matter the brand or type of shoe.      Edit: precise is a better word than accurate.       Also getting a lot of Nike exceptions. Don't own them so I haven't experienced that yet.       But in my case and range of 10 different shoes companies and styles i.e. boots, running shoes, sneakers, skateboarding shoes. They are the same number. 
LPT: Don't announce to others what you plan to do, instead, AFTER the task is completed, share what you did. Addictive dopamine gets released at a better time for reinforcing productive work in the future!*****Psychologists claim that telling people you're going to do something and getting their approval releases dopamine without actually doing the task, becoming a major reinforcement for not following through on plans. By keeping plans more private, you hold off on release of the addictive dopamine until it will reinforce you completing goals. It's a hack for your brain. You get addicted to getting things done!  Also, for those who like to play devil's advocate, the counter argument is that public display of goals does help for them to be achieved. There is truth to this, but is mostly refuted in terms of short term versus long term change. Public announcements hold us accountable out of fear and fear doesn't lead to long term intrinsic motivation and change only short term action as the driving force in the change is external rather than internal.   Lastly, I'm not saying not to talk through your goals with others, just be sure you're not doing it for the affirmation of setting the goal and be selective with who needs to know (hint: it's not everybody).  Edit: wow this took off  Edit2: thanks for the silver!  Edit3: I get it, dopamine isn't addictive but I can't adjust the title so yeah, there's that
LPT: Write every email as if they will get forwarded on to the CEO.*****
LPT: if you store boxes in a basement, put them on pallets. This will save your belongings if you get a few inches of water down there.*****Edit: never said wooden pallets
LPT If you are applying to a job make sure your resume is in PDF format.*****Most companies don't open any other types of documents so make sure you are getting seen by your potential employer.
LPT: Change the extension of any word document, spreadsheet or power point presentation to .zip. Then unzip the file and you'll find a media folder containing all the documents images.*****Mac and Linux may require an unzip via terminal for some document types
LPT: If someone confides in you with a problem they're having, your first instinct might be to try relating to them with a similar problem you've had. Avoid this as a first response as it often comes off as "one-upsmanship" rather than empathy.*****Whoa, this blew up while I was at work today.   Yes, obviously it's OK to eventually express with the person that you understand their issue as you've been through something similar at one point (especially if you can sense that's what they're looking for). I really just meant that you should avoid making your story the focus of your initial response before you've acknowledged the other person's problem and have validated how they're feeling. 
LPT: If you find yourself lost in unfamiliar wilderness, immediately STOP and begin marking your location - break brush, organize branches, or stones, or dig trenches into clear man made shapes*****People who are lost often begin to wander, and this strategy marks the first location you realized you were lost for both yourself and possible searchers. Title is a bit messy, but obviously terrain and environment will dictate the materials available to use for marking your location. Make your marking clear enough it will be able to withstand rain/weather, ideally for multiple days or even weeks.   Once you have established your "home base", you may begin searching for the trail or other signs of human activity. It is incredibly important however to do this with a calm and collected mind, not panicking and trying to push yourself in a random direction in desperate hope. Begin slowly, and always count your steps. Mark your path away from your "home base" as you move, so that there is a clear way back. At first, only try say 20 steps in as straight as a line as you can manage, before returning to your home base. Now try a line in the opposite direction, 20 steps and return. This approach is much safer with a compass, as you can stick to cardinal directions and there is less chance of you becoming turned around. Always be marking your passage, and always try to return to your base as it is much more likely to be close to where people would be traveling or looking for you. 
LPT: when buying a new appliance (eg, washer, dryer, dishwasher) ask an appliance REPAIRMAN which model he recommends. Don’t ask the salesman at Lowe’s...*****
LPT: Keep a pack of multi-colored electrical tape handy to color-code things that only seem obvious during their installation.*****
LPT: When applying for a new job take a note/screenshot of the key responsibilities so if you ever need to leave you can copy it and add those to your CV.*****
LPT: When using your laptop in bed, put a large book underneath to help with ventilation and maximizing battery life.*****Because bed sheets and comforters tend to clog the airways for fans, laptop devices can overheat fairly quickly. By using a book as a barrier, you get more battery life from your device AND as an added bonus, you won't have to listen to your laptop pretend it's a plane preparing for taking off.  
LPT: if you’re working tonight while daylight savings is rolling back an hour, make sure to keep track of that time so that your employer doesn’t cheat you out of an hour!*****This is especially important if you’re working in the food or bar industry! The time will go back and it’ll show that you got done way earlier. A lot of employees don’t catch this and they end up losing out on an hour of pay! Just keep that in mind friends and I hope everyone has a good night!
LPT: Make a recording of your voice with a sweet message or telling a story. If anything happens to you, your loved ones will greatly appreciate being able to listen to your voice again.*****Thought of this because  I recently found a recording of my grandpa telling me one of his stories from when he was a cop. Watching my grandma's reaction when she was able to hear his voice again years later... Everyone needs to do this for their family. You never know when something might happen, but especially older people and sick people need to do this.   And I know people have mentioned saving voice mails before, but having a story or a personalized message is so much better than a random voice message. People don't think about when they are going to die, and not everyone may think to save a voice message from you. Do this for your loved ones. Put it on a flash drive and label it, make sure it is somewhere your family can find it. Your loved ones will greatly appreciate it.
LPT: when making rice, just throw some broccoli on top when there is like 10mins left, it'll be perfectly steamed at the end and is a super easy way to add some nutrition with virtually zero extra work!*****I just thought of this on a whim one day and have been doing it ever since. It's SO easy and works great.  (Note: by the time there's 10 minutes left, the water level should be below the "rice level" so the broccoli isn't gonna be submerged or anything, they just rest on top)  (Note^2 can also do this with quinoa if you're into that)
LPT - Use the three breaths technique when you are nervous, stressed, tired, distracted or upset. Three slow deep breaths, in through the nose, out through the mouth, can help immediately with all these feelings and more. It’s discreet and you can do it anywhere.*****I’ve put the health flair on this for mental health, hope that’s ok!
LPT: If your roommates phone alarm is going off near by, you can turn it off by calling their phone!*****Used to have a roommate who had multiple alarms and would forget to turn them off while getting ready for work. Just call their phone and the alarm will shut off once you hang up
LPT: A single flower given unexpectedly, goes a lot further than expensive arrangements on expected holidays.*****Edit: Wow I totally did not expect this gain so much traction.   Edit 2: Obviously it doesn't have to be a flower. The idea is to let your SO know they still matter to you outside of when you're expected to. It goes for both men and women as well.   The idea boils down to something I've heard off and on over the years. Never stop dating your SO.   Also forgive me for my comma mistake. I get it no need to punish me further :]. 
LPT: When starting a new hobby, activity, or job even, search "things I wish I knew before I started [x]." This can get you a ton helpful tips to boost you when starting off.*****I did this for when I started guitar and helped a lot.
LPT: Mother's day and Father's day aren't always happy days for everyone. Reach out to friends and family members who may be having a tough time this father's day*****I myself get carried away in Hallmark holidays and forget that mother's day and Father's day isn't always a positive experience for people.   Reachout to those who may not be celebrating due to their relationship with their parents/ loss of parents , as the day can be pretty lonely, even a small text goes a long way.
LPT: When completing work from home, change into clothes you'd wear out of the house, and out of your trackpants/pyjamas. A small way to mentally wake up and feel 'prepped' for the working day.*****EDIT: Yikes, so many mixed opinions on here. Guess I rustled some jimmies with this one! EDIT2: Why is this gaining so much traction? Lol.
LPT: Blend dog food and low-sodium chicken broth together and freeze it in a hollow dog toy. It will keep your dog busy and occupied for hours while also providing them a healthier treat.*****Edit: Whoa FP!!! So many people to thank!   I definitely want to address some of the most popular comments:  A lot of people have brought up the mess factor, in my experience my dog finishes this well before it melts, if your dog is picky or loses interest in challenging tasks quickly this might not be for them or might need to be an outside only treat.  Also, definitely check your chicken broth for onions, many of you have mentioned that they are bad for doggo. My vet recommended this to me and did not mention this as a concern but I will definitely be taking this into consideration.   Kong balls/bones work best as they are very difficult for your dog to destroy.   TL;DR: might be best to give to dogs outside; onions are bad and in broth; Kong Balls are where it’s at!
LPT: If you have sticky residue on something, mix two parts vegetable/coconut oil with three parts baking soda. Works better than store bought Goo Gone*****Simple as that. Mix it up, scoop it on, rub it in with your fingers, & wash with soap and water to remove the oil.   Works on any material and won't scratch glass!!
LPT: you can download a sample ballot ahead of the Nov. 6th election to avoid confusion at the polls at be an informed voter*****The advantage of downloading a sample ballot ahead of time is that you can avoid a lot of confusion when confronted with ballot initiatives, judges, or whateve else you may not have been expecting to see and haven't researched how to vote. [Ballotpedia can help you out here](https://ballotpedia.org/Sample_Ballot_Lookup).   Or, you can google 'sample ballot 2018 *[your location]*' if Ballotpedia is missing yours for some reason.   To figure out where to vote, go to https://www.vote.org/polling-place-locator/  EDIT: Per request, I'd like to point that you can also avoid potential scheduling conflicts/ long lines by [voting early in many states](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/early-voting-in-state-elections.aspx#Early%20Voting%20Law%20Table).  
LPT: How to give a quick, impromptu speech or toast!*******Edit:** Thank you so much for all of your replies and comments, for helping to get this to the Front Page of the Internet, and big thank you to the two generous Gold donors!  Given the overwhelming response this thread has produced, I feel it is absolutely necessary to give credit to communication skills expert Dan O'Connor, a man whose work has empowered, inspired, and ultimately motivated me to try to help get his ideas out to all willing and deserving recipients.

Thank you!  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Most people would agree that the idea of speaking in front of large groups of people can be terrifying, and so we tend to avoid it whenever possible. There are times, however, when we are faced with the task and there's no running away: we must say a few words. The following is a template for success which you can use when it's your turn to speak, in just about any type of gathering, formal or informal.    **1. The Greeting**  *"Good..."*  The greeting is the easy part. You begin by simply wishing your audience a good morning, afternoon, evening, or whatever time of day it is. ***Good** evening everybody...*  **2. State the Event**  *"As we all know..."*  The second part is also very easy: You simply state the obvious and remind everybody what the purpose of the event or celebration is, and what you're all doing there. ***As we all know,** we're here to celebrate the marriage of John and Kate, and to show them our support as they begin their journey of love and life together...* Now you've got the ball rolling, and the words are coming out easily. You look like you know what you're doing up there, and people are listening. So now, it's time to....  **3. Establish Common Ground**  *"We've all..."*  It's important to include your audience as part of the message you're delivering. Talk about something both yourself and your audience can relate to regarding the event or celebration. ***We've all** had the wonderful opportunity to get to know John and Kate and enjoy watching their love develop...*  **4. State Why You're Speaking**  *"I..."*  Include a personal account, or tell a brief story to let people know why you specifically are talking. What gives you the right to be speaking..? ***I've** personally been very lucky to have John as a close friend of mine, and it's been quite amazing to watch how he's grown as a person, and couldn't be more pleased for him to have found someone like Kate to go about his life with...*   **5. Call for Action**  *"So let's all..."*  Finally, close your speech with a call for action. This lets everybody know that you're finished without you having to awkwardly say "That's it!" or "I'm finished, thank you"...that is how every weak speech is concluded and makes the audience uncomfortable. You should say something like ***"So let's all** raise a glass to John and Kate, and wish them well. Cheers!" or, **So Let's all** give a big round of applause to Mark for the outstanding job he's done while working with the company"*    Obviously, there are many different ways these leading lines can be used, but if you can commit them to memory and be prepared to use them next time you might be asked to speak, you will let go of all fear and anxiety, and people will be SO impressed with your ability to get up and give a confident, fluent speech in front of a group of people, while looking like you didn't even have to prepare! Good luck, and happy public speaking!
LPT: Before checking in at the airport, take a photograph of your luggage. A picture is worth a thousand words if your bags get lost!*****This has saved me a few times... If your bags become lost it is very easy to simply show the baggage claims representative a picture of your luggage on your phone rather than try to describe it, *especially* when there is a language barrier.  Edit: My first post to Reddit and it somehow made it to the front page! Thanks all!  
LPT: When packing plates, put paper plates between them to keep them from scratching/chipping*****
LPT: When wiring up a bathroom, install dimmable lights and light switches. They are MUCH easier on the eyes for those middle of the night events, and can double as a night light when you have guests.*****I did this to our main bedroom years ago, and have installed them in other bathrooms since then.  In many cases, it's as easy as replacing the light switch.  Of course, this doesn't work with fluorescent bulbs, and I'm not at all sure of the state of the technology with respect to LEDs.  Edit: This earned gold!?!?  No kidding!  For a quickie post I did 4 months ago?  I love this place.  Thanks, kind stranger.
LPT: If your milk smells sour, pour a little into a cup/glass and smell it again, often it is the residue in the neck/opening that is sour and not the milk inside.*****
LPT: Take 20 seconds out of your day and write down the serial number of your bicycle*****Don't be like me.         Source: Got my bike stolen, saw it online, can do nothing about it
LPT: When you cross a road, always make eye contact with the drivers of oncoming cars. Studies have shown that even our peripheral vision can identify faces when you are looked at and thus it increases the chance of being seen and avoids accidents.*****[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027711000345)
LPT: If you buy baby / spring greens in the plastic container, put a slice of paper towel in there after you open it. It absorbs the condensation and makes the greens last longer.*****
LPT: You can go to almost all museums in NYC for one dollar.*****I know a lot of people don't know much about this but you can get into almost all museums for only one dollar. The prices that are displayed in the museum and on their website are all suggestion donations in which they want you to pay but aren't required to get in. The process is just as easy as well. Simply go on the same line that everyone else goes on to get in and when they ask you for your payment, give them a whopping one dollar and bam you're in. I'm posting this because I recently heard a number of classmates that wanted to go but simply didn't have the money for the suggestion prices. Please spread this to all friends and family that might ever want to go to these museums in the future.  **Edit:** Damn did not expect this to blow up as big as it did, so thank you everyone who commented and voted on this post. First of all I want to state that I am a high school student that doesn't have a job so obviously this is something that is very convenient to many students and I. If you have the money to pay the suggested donation then I would recommend you at least pay a little more but that is totally up to you.  Okay, clarification on everything else, firstly this only applies to public museums such as the MOMA and the American Museum of Natural History. Private museums however make you pay whatever their admission is. I see some things in the comments saying that some private museums allow free access on certain days of the week but I am not a hundred percent sure that is accurate so I would recommend doing more research on that if that is something you are interested in. Secondly, this applies to various public museums within many other states and countries and is not only a thing that occurs in NYC as many people have stated below which I found to be very convenient to people that do not often come to NYC. Thanks again everyone for all the feedback and have fun at any museum you do plan on visiting in the future.  **Edit 2:** A word and a space.  **Edit 3:** Thank you for the gold kind stranger!  **Edit 4:** Thank you for the gold king stranger number 2!
LPT: Put some cat litter in the bottom of your trash can before you put a liner or bag in, that way if a bag leaks the cat litter will help absorb the liquid making it much easier to deal with.*****
LPT: If you find someone's wallet, bring it to their bank (check credit/debit cards). The bank will have their most updated contact info. The address on ID may not be the most updated.*****I've lost my wallet a couple of times (not stolen since no activity on cards) but the person who found it can't contact me to let me know where it is :(  Even if the address on the ID is correct, most people won't wait long enough for postage before cancelling their cards.  EDIT: Sorry if this wasn't clear but I didn't mean that you should get the address of the person from the bank. I meant that the bank could call the owner of the wallet for you and let them know whats up.
LPT, paying for an home alarm monitoring service is a waste of money*****Ive been investigating residential burglaries for over 10 years. Myself and every other cop I know does NOT pay for a burglar alarm monitoring service. Why you ask? Because most burglars are in and out in under 5 minutes. The alarm company has to call the house, then after they dont get an answer, they call the police. Then the dispatch center has to get the details, set up the call, and dispatch an officer. The quickest I have ever seen this process is about 8-10 minutes from the door being breached to an officer on scene.   If you want to make your house more secure, you can do a few things that burglars notice. a very large dog bowl at the front and back doors gets noticed, even if you dont have a dog. Also burglars avoid detection at all costs. Very obvious camera placement is a very good deterrent. Also wifi doorbells that have two way communication work well. There are many more, but alarm monitoring is a waste of money.   Edit*** Since people have asked me what is a good set up for home security without paying a monthly fee....I am a big fan of smart home technology....I specifically go with smartthings. I can trigger lights based on motion sensors, I have wifi enabled cameras that I can access on my smartphone that can trigger lights and alert my phone. I still have an alarm system in my home, I just dont pay to have it monitored. Everything I listed does not have a monthly fee. Basically I am the monitoring service for my home, and im much quicker than a dispatcher calling another dispatcher.  ****edit 2***well I leave for a few hours and come back to the front page and gold, thank you random guilders...seems like people are interested in these kinds of tips from an actual law enforcement officer, I'll try and think of some more. Also yes I'm aware of the "a" and "an" rule, it was a typo lol
LPT: If a child misplaced an object of yours, go down to their level to try and find it.*****Kids are shorter and can often see spots that as grown ups we cannot.  Walking on your knees or or crawling might make you find whatever they decided to hide easier.
LPT: Tired of all the ads in one of the free game apps you’re playing? Go to your settings and turn off the apps access to cellular data. Enjoy the ad free game play!*****
LPT: if someone is explaining something and keeps repeating themselves, there's a good chance that it's because they feel that you're not understanding them.*****By summarising what they are trying to say, it will either reassure them that you do understand or it will highlight exactly where the miss understanding is.   EDIT: well this certainly blew up!   Reading some of the comments, it's clear that a lot of people aren't quite understanding where I'm coming from. Basically what I'm saying is that when people feel like you're not understanding them, some people may repeat themselves. If you summarise what they are saying, it will hopefully reassure them that you understand, if not, at least you'll know which part you don't understand. :p
LPT: When you start working full time, make a real effort to hang out with friends who invite you to hang out with them*****The days really start to fly by when you're working full time and you're going to have fewer and fewer opportunities to see your buddies from school or college as the number of responsibilities you have increase. Its a real bummer when you clear part of your weekend to see someone and they flake out on you. People remember that.
If you think highly of someone, tell them.*****I've experienced it too many times that I find out someone genuinely respects me and looks up to me when they're introducing me to someone else. I've caught myself doing this to other people I think highly of as well.  All it takes is one sentence, but it can change everything for that person (or just make their day). It's really not that hard. Do it!
LPT: when dealing with lawyers, tell them everything. Lawyers can only assist you with the information you give them, and trying to hide something from them can make your situation far worse. This is especially true with situations where you need to declare past convictions, or drugs.*****
LPT: When using a website chat feature type your messages in word or something else and copy and paste them into the chat. Support reps can see everything you type as you type it regardless if you send it.*****
LPT: If you’re feeling stressed or overwhelmed because you have so much to do, make a list and physically cross them off or remove them from your phone as you go. It will let you know you’re making progress and give you a confidence boost that the others are also achievable.*****
LPT: To check if a map is up to date, look for South Sudan. It is the world's newest country, gaining its independence from Sudan in 2011.*****
LPT: If you share an 'inside joke' with a friend around other people, just let them know what it is even if they won't get it. People don't appreciate being excluded.*****
LPT: Trying to catch your dog that got out/off its leash? Try laying down.*****I've never known a dog to shy away from licking someone's face.  After watching someone chase their dog around for 20 minutes(the dog thinking it was a game) I walked over and layed down. The dog immediately came over to lick my face and I grabbed its collar.
LPT: Having trouble learning or grasping a concept? Pretend you're trying to explain it to someone else and your brain will trick itself into understanding it better.*****
LPT: If someone attempts to do something, especially for the first time, don't encourage them by telling them it's easy, it puts pressure on them to do it right first time and downplays their success when they achieve it.*****
LPT: Always be gracious when friends or classmates get jobs you both applied to, they might be in a position to hire you in the future*****
LPT: Want a password that always "stays" with you? The back cover of every hand watch has a unique serial number you can use as a password and never forget.*****And even if you lose your watch, the serial numbers are still in the warranty paper.  Most serial numbers have a combination of letters and numerals.  Edit: If you have multiple passwords secured on a third party software/website, you can set the master password to the watch serial number.
LPT: If you drop something small on the floor and can't find it, put a sock over the vacuum arm. There will be enough suction to pick up the thing you lost, but it won't be sucked into the vacuum itself.*****Just make sure the sock doesn't have holes.  You can also stretch the sock and secure it with a rubber band.
LPT: on ios if you hold down space bar you can go anywhere in the sentence to fix any mistakes instead of tapping and missing the letter.*****Apparently it works on other phones too!  edit 2: it works on androids with gboard i believe!  edit3: i’m glad i could help everyone, thank you all!  edit 4: i’ve been asked to clarify, if you hold down on space bar on some android and most ios phones you can slide it to and part of what you’re typing to fix and typos, mistakes, etc.  edit 5: if you have a phone with 3d touch it doesn’t matter where you press on the keyboard

LPT: When starting a free trial go ahead and cancel (if possible) as soon as you accept, that way it won’t sneak up on you and leave you paying for it later*****
LPT: If your roommate's wakeup alarm is going off after they've already left the room (i.e. they're in the shower), call their phone and hang up to turn it off.*****Edit: This is in reference to an alarm on your roommate's PHONE. No, calling a phone will not turn off your alarm clock. (Thanks to the many, many people who pointed this out).   I mentioned this in a long-buried comment, but I've only used this with my roommate's iPhone on iOS 10. Some people say this doesn't work on other phones, so please go ahead and try it out, I hope it helps you!   Also, this is for either extremely lazy people, like myself (I am someone who uses chrome Remote Desktop for my computer 6 feet away and I have both my TV and LED light strip remotes command-strip velcroed to the wall next to my bed), or for anyone whose roommate has left their phone in a private/locked room.   Interestingly, some people have suggested flipping the electric breaker on and off real quick to reset any alarm CLOCKS left on in locked rooms while the owners are away. (As always, the real LPT is in the comments!)
LPT: Try foods that you hated as a kid, your taste buds change every 7 years and you're very likely to enjoy most of the foods you disliked.*****Most people are aware of this, and while I still dislike the smell of most of these foods, they taste delicious to me now. Don't just smell and dismiss them.  I disliked brusle sprouts, apricots, dried fruit, etc, and now in my early 30's I recently tried and love all of those things.  
LPT: if your copay for medication is too high, check the website of the company, they often have free coupons that could cover the entire copay or dramatically reduce it. They’d rather pay for your copay and receive your insurance payout than you not take their medication.*****Source: years of experience having to be on expensive meds and biologics. Biologics can cost hundreds even with great insurance but the company programs get that down to 50 or even 5 bucks. I also got Epiduo for free when it originally cost $118 before the coupon. 
LPT: People are usually not fired for a big fuck up at work. They are usually fired for how they acted after the fuck up. So stay calm, be upfront & honest, and try minimize the damage*****
LPT: If you’re going to a baby shower, consider bringing clothes in sizes that aren’t newborn or 0-3 months. A lot of people receive clothes in these sizes and don’t have as many options when their baby grows out of them.*****3-6 months and 6-9 months are great options!   Edit to add: this goes for diapers too!

LPT: Put glowsticks on your dog's neck when camping so you can see where they are at night.*****I was camping and attached glowsticks to my dog's collar. It was way easier than carrying a flashlight when taking them out to use the bathroom.
LPT: When getting an oil change (or other quick service) at your dealership, turn your phone's Bluetooth off*****Your phone will automatically connect to your car when the technician (ie, me) starts your car to bring it in for service (yes, your Bluetooth can reach the car 100+ feet away at times).  This switches the phone call from your handset to the car, interrupting your phone call.  We do not want nor like to interrupt phone calls we have no business listening to in the first place, or angering you or whomever you were talking to.  EDIT:. R.I.P. inbox.  Wow.  Didn't think this would blow up like it did!
LPT: Alone on Thanksgiving? Find a soup kitchen or community center serving Thanksgiving dinner to volunteer at. Not only will you being doing something kind for others, but you will get to meet and talk with others and will (likely) get a plate of Thanksgiving food as well.*****
LPT for people who watch Netflix on their laptops: Load it in Internet Explorer or Safari to get 1080p. Google Chrome will only play in 720p.*****I found this out a few weeks ago but with Orange is the New Black out today I figure it's more relevant now.   https://help.netflix.com/en/node/23742  Edit: I did not expect this to get so many upvotes. I'm glad this was useful advice! Thanks to whoever gilded me also.   A lot of people are asking about FF, I don't know but I think 720 also. I also have no idea why I said laptop, not desktop (or better yet, computer). It doesn't matter, we're all in the PC Master Race.   Oh, and as people have pointed out, if you're on Windows 8/8.1 and you don't mind watching in full screen without clicking onto other tabs, the Netflix App on the windows store will play in 1080p/5.1.   Tbh, Netflix need to get 4K PC support and sort out these chrome issues.   Now everyone stop commenting and go digest some OitnB in glorious 1080.

LPT: You can opt-out of Reddit using your data, and collecting info from 3rd parties, for targeted advertisements.*****I know it's a fairly common thing these days but if you're like me and signed up several years ago you probably never noticed the change in targeted advertisements and 3rd party data sharing settings.   They can be changed here: [https://www.reddit.com/personalization](https://www.reddit.com/personalization)  Edit: Oh, er... that kinda blew up a bit. Thanks for the gold Dr Smartass. 
LPT: when cutting garlic, oil up your blade, so the garlic won‘t stick to it.*****
LPT: When giving change, place coins in the open palm BEFORE paper money and/or receipt*****I feel this should be taught at every retail job. I had no idea until my boss at a family owned toy store told me. This makes things much easier for the customer, reducing fumbling and the feeling of being in the way. Now, as a customer, it drives me crazy when I get a coin sandwich that I don't have time to manage.  Source: Worked retail for many moons  FPE: Didn't plan on starting the next world war. Money really is the root of evil!
LPT: Ask yourself "Will this still be a big deal a month from now?" This can help you figure out if something is worth getting upset or worry about.*****Without being too specific, even the smallest things in life can stirr up you'r mind having a hard time letting go or forget sometimes. The faster you learn to not care, the better you'r days will be. 
LPT: If you have a college ID, ask every place you buy something if they have a student discount. Most places that do won’t advertise it.*****I work at a store in a college town and we don’t advertise our student discount because we would lose money by advertising it, but if people ask we still give it to them.  Edit:  This post has gotten a lot of attention, just a few more important notes:  • there are apps (like UNiDAYS) that tell you what places offer student discounts  • it also doesn’t hurt to ask whenever you initially enter a store “what discounts do you have” • always check the current signage in the store. My store is plastered all over with signs about what sales we have going on at the time but I’ll mention our sales to someone and they’ll be surprised (as they didn’t read the signage)

LPT: In order to be a better conversationalist, don't ask yes/no questions. Instead, ask ones that require a more thoughtful, in-depth response.*****
LPT: If you buy a new car, and the dealership calls and says there's an issue with the contract and you need to come back and re-sign, do not do it until you have them send you the new contract and mark all the changes.*****Someone mentioned car dealerships doing this in another thread, and I didn't even think about it when it happened to me. I went home and looked at the original contract and the contract they had me re-sign and noticed several differences that I didn't notice before because my payment was the same and, due to our friendly conversation, I was admittedly distracted, trusted him, and didn't read the new contract because my payment was exactly the same.   What the dealership had done was originally financed my car through the dealership for a lower interest rate, then changed a lot of the finance numbers to ensure that everything matched for me in the short term (i.e. my monthly payment) but my interest rate jumped three percent, I assume the commission for the salesman had jumped, and they sold my contract to another finance company. The numbers inside the contract including the final sale price of the car, the trade in of my car, additional warranty for mechanical issues, the gap coverage, and other miscellaneous dealership fees had changed dramatically to suit the needs of the finance contract to ensure that they could get the financing. I'm now getting the paperwork from the finance company to ensure that what the dealership sent them matches what they gave me.  TL:DR - Don't sign anything without reading everything first, and get all changes in writing which highlights all changes before signing a new contract from any dealership.  Edited to remove an assumption on commission.  Edit 2 for clarification - The dealership informed me during the first signing that I was approved through one finance company and had me sign the contract, and idiotically (my fault admittedly, while letting the guy talk to me through the signing and not paying attention to what I was reading,) what I was actually signing was financing through the dealership. The "error" was that in the 12 days between the first and second signing, they had actually sold my contract from their dealership to the finance company that I was already approved for (or that they had informed me I was approved through.) So, the second contract was the exact same form as the first, but the interest rate, many of the numbers were different, as well as the finance company had changed from the dealership to the finance company they had already informed me I was approved through.

LPT: When purchasing a used car, make sure the check engine light turns on when you first start the car. A lot of people rip out the bulb so you don't know that the car needs repairs!*****I'm paying the price of this mistake 1 year after buying my first car. Purchased a 2004 outback for $3900 in excellent condition (ha, so I thought) only to find out the head gasket is leaking, as well as the O2 sensor and catalytic converter are fucked up. I basically have to buy a new car with the very little money I have and I probably won't get a penny for my own car unless I lie just like the asshole who sold me the car did to me.  Edit: I know the head gasket wouldn't trip the check engine light, but the fact that my o2 sensor and catalytic converter need to be fixed and my CEL has never once turned on tells me that he tampered with it in some way.  Whether he ripped out the bulb or painted it or whatever, the fucking light doesn't light up. That's the point.
LPT: even if no one sees your art or photos, don’t stop creating them.*****
LPT: If you’re alone and trying to find the correct breaker to do electrical work, plug a radio into the outlet where you need to work and turn it up all the way. When the music stops, you’ll know you’ve got the right breaker.*****They make tools to do this, but this works in a pinch rather than walking back and forth.    Also you should ABSOLUTELY still test the outlet/fixture if it’s still hot or not.   
LPT: Turn off mobile data when using an app that doesn't require an internet connection so no adverts appear*****All free apps tend to have annoying adverts, having no internet connection means no ads.    *Edit - wow front page :O Did not expect that, on iPhone you can turn off mobile data for specific apps!  *Edit 2 - I understand the point that developers will lose some money but fact of the matter is, most free apps will show an annoying advert every minute, the videos ones use up allot of data. So maybe they should reduce the frequency to discourage this. I still see adverts when on Wifi.  *Final Edit - Allot of developers are commenting on how they don't like this and lose money. I wouldn't have to do this if ads weren't so intrusive and I didn't get ads ever 30-60 seconds, especially video ones. 
LPT: If you move to a new place, or simply want to make friends, try volunteering. Volunteer at as many places as you have the time for, long term or one-time events: parks, beach clean up, library, museum, local animal shelter, fundraisers, etc.*****Edit: For everyone who is asking, here are some ideas for finding volunteer opportunities: In the US volunteermatch.org  www.unitedway.org/get-involved/volunteer# You can certainly try your local public library wherever you are.  And if all else fails, visit a local non-profit that does something you are interested in.
LPT: Crumple your aluminum foil for crispier frozen fries that are easier to flip.*****Crumpling the foil crinkles it, so it has less surface area to make contact with the fries.  This makes them stick less, crispier and less likely to be burnt.  Also works with taquitos, fishsticks and other types of lazyman's food.  Edit: jebus this blew up. From the comments:  Alright, it's aluminium... the one time autocorrect failed me.  No, were not frying the fries, nor using cooling racks!  It's been debunked, though I still notice a difference.  None of this matters because aluminum is toxic and parchment paper is better!  Edit 2: Front page while I was asleep.  (There's a lounge!)  Edit III: aluminum is right too.  We're good again, autocorrect.

LPT: Learn some basic information about your car, (engine type, model, year) and relay it confidently when getting maintenance. It will significantly reduce the amount of stuff they try to sell you on.*****I learned this from years of getting maintenance/repairs done at various locations. You almost always get asked the engine type, or year of your vehicle. If you memorize some basic information about your car, and respond quickly and confidently, it comes across that you know a lot about cars, and they won't try to rip you off with things you don't need.

LPT: 15 years Repairing Electronics Here: With Liquid Damaged Electronics, DON'T Use Rice, Instead Use A Fan (explanation inside)*****I've spent nearly 20 years repairing liquid/water damaged electronics. More specifically, cell phones. In the old days, we'd open the phones up, clean the corrosion, resolder, etc. Recently, they've (the manufacturers) moved away from local repairs and moved more towards warranty replacements, swap outs (FRU = factory replacement units) & insurance. Now if you want your electronics repaired locally, you have to visit 3rd party independent people since you can no longer have it done in a corporate-ran store.  I know rice is the go-to recommendation for water damaged phones and other electronics, and it works, to an extent. It will **passively** absorb moisture. Unfortunately, you don't want to passively absorb the moisture, you want to *actively* **remove** the moisture as quickly as possible.  The longer the moisture is sitting on those circuit boards, the higher the risk of corrosion. And corrosion on electrical components can happen within just a few short hours. If the damage isn't severe, we'd take contact cleaner (essentially 92% or better rubbing alcohol, the higher the percentage, the quicker it will evaporate) and scrub the white or green powder (the corrosion that formed) with a toothbrush to remove it. If that corrosion crosses contacts, it can cause the electronics to act up, fail or short out. The liquid itself almost never is directly responsible for failed consumer electronics, it's the corrosion that takes place after the fact (or the liquid damaging the battery, a new battery fixes this issue obviously).   Every time I see someone recommend rice I kinda twinge a little inside because while it does dry a phone out slightly better than just sitting on a counter, it really doesn't do much to prevent the corrosion that's going to be taking place due to the length of time the liquid has had to fester inside the phone or whatever.   What you want to do is set the item in front of a fan with constant airflow. Take the device apart as much as you can without ruining it (remove the battery, etc) so that the insides can get as much airflow as possible. Even if it's not in direct contact with the air, the steady air blowing over the device will create a mini vacuum effect and pull air from inside. It's just a small amount but it's significantly better than just allowing the rice to passively absorb the evaporated moisture. True, rice can act as a desiccant, but a fan blowing over whatever is orders of magnitude faster.   I personally will take apart a piece of electronics completely, and put those items in front of a fan, and if you have the relevant knowledge, I highly recommend doing so as well. But if you don't, it's not that big of an issue. What you want to avoid at all costs, however, is **heat**. Do not put your phone inside an oven or hot blow dryer, heat can damage electronics just as bad as liquid, sometimes more so. Heat, extreme cold and liquid are bad for electronics & cell phones. A fan (lots of airflow) is 99 out of 100 times better at removing moisture quickly than rice. I would say 100 out of 100 but I'm sure there's going to be some crazy situation or exception I haven't thought of that someone will come in and point out. I'd like to remind people that exceptions are just that, they don't invalidate the rule. 
LPT: If someone is treating you to a meal and you're wondering how much you should spend, ask them what they're ordering to get a better idea of the range.*****
LPT: If someone interrupts a storyteller to steal the spotlight, maintain eye contact with the original speaker to encourage them and discourage the interrupter.*****Many times a more enthusiastic or extroverted conversationalist will attempt to hijack a story to have the moment of glory, but discourage this behavior by continuing to engage the original speaker instead of turning your attention to the hijacker. It will also discourage and subtly inform the hijacker of their rudeness without calling them out in a humiliating way. 
LPT: Instead of asking others if they "know" a subject, ask them if they're "familiar with" it; people are less likely to feel challenged by the latter phrasing (and as a result, more likely to answer honestly).*******No:** *"Do you know anything about The Wiggles?"* or *"Do you know the Pythagorean theorem?"*  &nbsp;  **Yes:** *"Are you familiar with The Wiggles?"* or *"Are you familiar with the Pythagorean theorem?"*

LPT: If you’re going somewhere for Thanksgiving with the hopes of bringing home leftovers, bring your own food containers.*****Edit: 1. obviously this is assuming you are very close with the host and are pretty sure leftovers will be OFFERED.  2. unless you are bringing something to share in the containers, leave them in your car until the leftovers are OFFERED.  3. HELP WITH THE DAMN DISHES!
LPT: if you have a basil plant take the small fresh leafs first and not the big old ones.*****This tip comes from a friend of mine who is into growing a certain kind of recreational plant.  I usually did it the other way around, taking the big ones first to make space for the small ones. Turns out the other way around is much better. The big leafs are basically the main power source of the plant. Taking all of them weakings the plan and it will slow down the growth.  Takingthe small ones will declutter the plant and make space for more small leafs.  (This just applies to a heavllily used plant, not a fresh one where all leaves are big)   Edit:  As many pointed out, this is not ment to be a tip for growing weed.   Additionally I have to add, it's true, if the big leaves take all sun from the small ones, take some of them out as well. This tip is ment for already harvested basil plants, with some big leaves and a lot of small ones coming. Like many I always thought, the big ones are "ready" and make space for the small ones. In this situation rather take some small ones than big ones, and help the plant grow back faster.

LPT - To all cops with a '7-11' in their district: stop by after midnight and you can get food for the homeless*****7-11 stores have their own subs, fruit and some other food that have a sell-by date, and when it reaches midnight on that date, they are required to throw it away. The food is still good though, and you can ask the clerk after 12 if they have anything that they're throwing away that night that you can take to the homeless. The stores in my area always have a bunch of stuff they're throwing away, and they're not allowed to take it home but if you're on duty and explain what it's for then they usually are more than happy to. I usually wait untill around 1 a.m. so they've had a chance to gather all their throwaways and mark them off.  And on the cold nights, they usually will let you grab a tray of hot chocolates to pass out as well.   Edit: according to /u/StoneColdJonStark : QuikTrip, RaceTrac, WaWa, Sheets, and all manner of similar convenience stores do about the same thing at around the same time of night. Don't limit yourself geographically!

LPT: Do not announce on social media that you'll be traveling for the holidays.*****
LPT: You do not owe strangers anything. If someone approaches you in a manner that makes you uncomfortable, it is your right to ignore them, walk away, or call for help.*****I see so many people seemingly trapped into politeness by societal norms, that they feel obliged to engage with people who are clearly making them uncomfortable. Fuck people who think it's okay to harass you and expect to be treated with politeness.
LPT: When lost in a new city, ask for directions from someone walking a dog.*****Especially when exploring a tourist city, it can be hard to know who to ask. Someone walking a dog is most likely a local and will have good walking directions. Also asking about their cute dog is a great ice breaker for anyone nervous about asking a stranger for directions. 
LPT: Start thawing a large turkey today for Thanksgiving (USA)*****Retired butcher here.   Turkey thaws at a rate of 3-4 lbs a day (edit: thaw in the fridge, bottom shelf, on a cookie sheet), so a 21 lb bird needs to start thawing now to be ready for Thanksgiving. Note- drips from the turkey can contaminate food below.  Other turkey tips:   * Don't stuff a bird for best results. Stuffing stops the air in the cavity from cooking the bird and makes it so the outside must be overcooked to get the inside to a safe temperature.    * A safer alternative to stuffing that still enhances its flavor: butterfly the turkey and cook it on a bed of stuffing.  This will reduce cooking time, look at a few recipes to get a feel for how long it takes.  * If you have to thaw a turkey quickly, keeping it in cold running water for a few hours will work. However, this method take more work, can add another unknown time element if done the day of, wastes water, and I don't think the end results are a good as a slow thaw.    * Avoid recipes that cook at 350°F or higher for the duration. I cook my 18-22lb bird at 250°F for about 3 hours, then go up 400°F for about an hour. (Edit: apparently Alton Brown's method starts high, then goes low, so there are other ways)  * Use a probe meat thermometer to tell if the turkey is done. White meat should be be 165°F (maximum, after resting, the bird will continue to cook, so pull it ~10°F earlier) ~~and dark meat 180°F.~~. Apparently 170-175 for dark meat is recommended by Cook's Illustrated.  * While there are minor differences between brands, almost all frozen turkeys are the same. I always get the cheaper store brands. The only real differences are between Kosher/organic/seasoned. * (edit) Don't baste or open the door to peek- it's more important to maintain a constant temperature. With a higher temp near the end, the bird will brown very nicely.   Swing by /r/meat or PM me if you have questiions. I hope all your birds come out well.    Edit: Front page @_@. RIP my inbox. Thanks to all those who set me straight on the temps.
LPT: Carry a small pocket knife with you for the next few days. You will become the hero who can open all the new packages and boxes.*****(title)
LPT: Don’t forget to donate food this summer! Typically, folks excessively donate in the winter to food banks before or during the holidays, which is great. But in the summer, donations are lowest, so this is when the food bank’s need is greatest.***** And remember when donating: would you want to  eat it? Nutrient rich items like canned vegetables, fruit, and tomato sauce or high protein cans of chicken or tuna will do a lot more good for people than empty calories like top ramen or powdered soup mixes. 
LPT: When someone suffers a personal tragedy, don't ask if they need anything. They'll almost always say they don't. Instead, just pick something, and do it.*****
LPT: If you're a business owner, keep a vector file of your logo handy*****You will avoid any problems when sending your logo off for promotional purposes such as printing t-shirts, banners, etc. I work for a marketing company, and the amount of poor quality JPEG's of logos I get is absurd. If you've paid to have a logo designed, you should have a vector file of it yourself.
LPT: a Word file, is a zip in disguise.*****Just rename your file from .docx to .zip and unzip. You will get a folder of all stuff inside the doc, like all the images and some crazy xml content.  As a web developer, my clients often send stuff for me to place on their website, mostly in a doc with dozens of pages with images. I got tired of saving every single image from the doc. Too many clickz. Much carpel tunnel.  This saves me a lot of time so I just had to share this awesome trick.  (Don't know what specific versions support this trick, I tested with word for mac 2011. I think it also works with Powerpoint files.)  Edit: Wow, this blew up! Let me express my feelings in a Haiku:   I got reddit gold.   Thank you all for the upvotes!   I can die in peace.    Edit2: Reformatted the haiku to support line breaks as suggested by /r/ConsummateK (mini-LPT: add 2 spaces behind your returns) 
LPT: If you screw up and inconvenience someone, apologize once, then move on (by correcting your mistake if possible). Apologizing repeatedly & profusely doesn't help anything, it's just you trying to make yourself feel better.*****Edit: Wow, this blew up. Apparently i a) hit on something a lot of people either really agreed with or needed to hear, and also b) am singlehandedly destroying this sub by posting advice on decent adult behaviour instead of, i dunno, how to tie your shoes better or something (hint: reverse the first over-under; it'll feel weird to do but your knot won't slip).  TO CLARIFY: This was meant to be advice for situations of a MINOR nature, screw-ups like being late for an appointment or scratching someone's DVD by accident. Small stuff. If you really hurt someone, or betray their trust in a serious way, YOU NEED TO APOLOGIZE. A lot. Until the person you wronged decides you're done, keep apologizing. Like so:  /r/LifeProTips i'm REALLY sorry i posted something i thought would be useful or interesting but wasn't what you want to see from this subreddit. I'm seriously really sorry; i'm new here. I won't do it again. Sorry. Really.   Also: If you need to remember to do something tomorrow, change your phone's lock screen to an image that will remind you of it.
LPT: When you move into a new place, find out where your main water valve is. You may need to turn it off quickly if a pipe bursts. I just learnt this the hard way.*****
[LPT] If it's the same price, buy the hard copy rather than the online streamed version. You can lose access to what you've purchased if the streaming service decide to change their terms and conditions.*****
LPT: When selecting a text with your mouse, double-click on the first word, hold down the mouse on the second click and then select your text. It will now select text by words, not characters.*****
LPT: When struggling to hang a picture or mirror on a screw on the wall, push the spikes of a fork down over the screw,with the handle pointing up. Then slide the picture string down the fork down onto the screw.Then remove fork.*****This magnificent illustration was kindly donated by u/bluesatin  Thank-you   http://i.imgur.com/lBovZZE.png
LPT: try and spend time with the elderly if possible. A little conversation with a lonely old neighbor every now and then can really brighten their life.*****
LPT: When you are handed a claim ticket for anything (dry cleaning, luggage, valet parking, etc.) immediately take a picture of it with your phone. That way, if it becomes lost you can still claim your property without a hassle.*****
LPT: If you're on vacation and find yourself in a souvenir shop... DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING. Places may rig certain "expensive" items to fall apart, then forcing you to pay for damages. Learned this the hard way in Mexico*****
LPT: If adopting an animal from a shelter, expect a few initial behavioral issues*****This is in no way acting as a discouragement! I've spent the last 10 years in some sort of animal rehabilitation and shelter volunteering, and it breaks my heart to see how often animals get returned after a few days because "he's just not adjusting."  In many cases, the animals I've personally worked with have been rescued from abuse, malnourished, or strays. Volunteers work very hard and have several guidelines as to what makes and animal ready for adoption. The top 5 complaints I've seen in my experience are:  **My new dog keeps going to the bathroom in the house**: First thing to consider in this situation is, *where was the animal living while at the shelter?* some shelters may keep their animals in runs or cells and often these animals don't get walked. That creates a habit of the animal being used to using the bathroom inside. Proactive walking really helps correct this problem! Take your dog out often in the first few weeks and then start to dial it back gradually.   **Our kitty was so friendly and playful at the shelter, now she just hides all day, I don't think that we're "connecting"**: Your kitty was so happy and playful because she was somewhere she was accustomed to. Imagine, you may have shared a room with a friend, had a set schedule. All of a sudden you were taken, probably put in a cardboard box (also DONT LEAVE CATS IN CARDBOARD CARRIERS!! Cats are sensitive to over heating and it could have life threatening implications. Bring your own well ventilated carrier when adopting) went for a scary ride and were dumped out into a strange environment **alone** and away from everyone you knew. Give kitty time, she'll get into a rhythm with you. The best thing you can do right now is provide a clean litter box, fresh water and proper feeding at set times. DONT DRAG KITTY OUT FROM UNDER THE BED, this only enforces the need to find a better spot to hide.  **New Fido does nothing but bark non-stop all day**: FIRST OFF, this complaint usually comes from apartment dwellers. If you're adopting a dog make sure **beforehand** that your lease allows pets. Don't just get a dog then when your land lord shows up to say you have to get rid of it claim that it's a service dog/your just watching it for a friend. Fido is alone! Fido used to be in a place where there was a lot of commotion and all this silence is *weird!* HOOMAN WHERE DID YOU GO?? Dogs are pack animals, and when they're alone they feel vulnerable. Long walks and playtime before you have to leave for an extended period of time are good remedies to this. Leave a TV on on a low volume to shield all the scary outside noises. In my personal experience crate training was a great tool, but don't get one too big or too small (big enough to stand up without ducking the head, and and turn around in). This method was recommended to me by my vet and just happened to work, but it may not work for you. Professional consultation about a dogs excessive barking habits is never a bad idea. All relationships take work!  **Why does my new pet act so lethargic? They were so full of energy when we first met! It's what I liked about her!**: What are you feeding her? Is it the same food she was eating at the shelter? Sudden changes in diet can trigger upset tummies and more negative consequences. Food changes should be done gradually, consult your vet on the best way to do this if they start showing signs of stomach upset. It also has to do with the stress of being in a new environment, all these knew sights and smells are exhausting to process!  **Our new pet doesn't get along with our existing ones**: This. One. Is. huge. How would you feel if your s/o, roommate brought home some guy named chad and was like "oh yea, chad lives here now." Dogs (even though they're pack animals), and cats can be very territorial. This behavior may have only shown up when you caught kitty- hair standing on end making those *hilarious* guttural meowing noises; kitty doesn't understand that this new kitten is "pet of the family now" and not the evil outdoor neighbor cat. Even though you're in the same household, introductions should be done gradually. Giving each animal an opportunity to sniff and item that has the others scent on it, allowing them to sniff though doors etc. if your bringing a new dog home to your existing dogs, consider taking them to a dog park or anywhere fenced in that's not your house. This gives them the chance to interact and also escape each other if they feel really threatened, and it's not on territory that your dog may be trying to defend. Make sure interactions are positive, this doesn't mean that they get along every time- but that the animals get praise for not being aggressive.  Hope this helps some people navigate the first few days of shelter pet adoption!  And P.S. There's probably a bunch of typos.   Edit 1: thank you u/E32636, u/bluesoul, and anonymous user for the gold!  Edit 2: I mentioned a few times in here about my kitter constantly peeing in the house. We took him to the vet and found out he had a UTI and was prescribed a prescription diet. Also something to consider when thinking about getting a new pet! What you think is a behavioral problem might actually be a medical problem!   Edit 3: Sorry to all the other "Chads" I may have offended! Lol
LPT: If you were in an accident and had a car seat in the vehicle, you can take it to your local fire department and have them inspect it for free. If it's unsafe, they can give you a slip for your insurance company to replace it.*****
LPT: Never send an email when you're in a heightened emotional state, even if you're extremely happy. Wait until you're feeling neutral, then send it.*****EDIT: Thanks for the upvotes, pals! I did want to clarify the part about "never" sending an email when you're extremely happy.   If you're responding to an email about someone's amazing news about winning the lottery/buying a house/getting engaged etc. it probably makes sense to write them back with a message full of passion and emotion. I was thinking more in professional setting or in situations involving money or some kind of transaction. Sometimes when we're really happy, we agree to do things we wouldn't normally do and we get taken advantage of.  I feel most people already know it's a bad idea to send an email when you're super pissed about something, and that you should wait until you calm down. But fewer people (including myself, until recently) don't realize it might be a good idea to wait until you've calmed down from being in an extremely joyous/excited state before sending that email.
LPT: Do family often waste money on gifts that aren’t your taste? Ask for a luxury version of an everyday product you use, such as olive oil.*****We do this, and it’s made birthdays so much better! They get to give something that seems fancy (even though the difference between top shelf and supermarket brand can be like $10 max), and we get something we’ll actually love using. 
LPT If you work a desk job, have a large cup of water to sip on throughout the day. More water is better for your health and it will cause you to have to go to the restroom more frequently, getting you up from your seat and walking around more.*****It's surprising how many people will eat all day and switching to drinking water  between meals instead is a lot better for you.
LPT: Getting married? Create a separate email account just for your wedding to avoid spam and keep organized*****Especially if you are corresponding with national wedding chains, such as The Knot or David's Bridal, your email inbox will be spammed with multiple emails per day once you start using their services. This LPT has the additional benefit of keeping all your wedding planning emails in one place.
LPT: When you are on a long roadtrip and want to eat at a restaurant by the highway, always pick one with a lot of trucks outside. Truckers often take the same tour hundreds of times and know for sure where to stop for a good (and cheap) meal.*****
LPT: For better baked frozen pizza, ignore the instructions on the box. Fully thaw the pizza the bake it for 5-8 minutes on the hottest temperature your oven will go.*****Having recently done a lot of experimenting with "upgrading" cheap frozen pizzas to make them taste less, well, cheap and frozen, this has been by far the most important trick.   Commercial pizzas are baked in stone ovens that get up to 700- 1000 degrees, which is why they bake so quickly and end up with nice crispy crusts and un-burned everything else. Your home oven will never get that hot but you can try to get as close as possible to emulate the effect.   Cook the pizza on the bare rack to maximize air circulation if you don't have a pizza stone or a cast iron skillet/slab. If you have either of those, heat it in the oven first and then cook the pizza on that once the oven hits its max temperature.   For even better pizza, brush the crust with olive oil before you bake and sprinkle either fresh garlic or garlic powder on it. (The garlic flavor helps to balance out the usually heavy handed and far too sweet sauce that goes on your average frozen pizza).   Edit: Forgot to mention, keep a close eye on the pizza if you're going to do this! 5-8 minutes is a pretty general number and, depending on the temperature your oven maxes out at, your pizza could go from "perfect" to "burned to a crisp" in the span of a minute.
LPT: When writing a thesis or scientific paper, don't end the day with a completed section. Write a few sentences into the next section to help yourself get started the next day.*****
LPT: If your bag gets lost when flying on most major airlines, go buy replacement clothes/shoes/sunglasses etc. and keep the receipts, you will get reimbursed by the airline. So long as the total amount is less than $500 most airline reps can approve it without going through corporate.*****Most bags have an upward liability limit of around $3500 per ticketed customer so you can get reimbursed for items bought above $500 but you have to deal with the claims dept. in the airline. It is much easier to just take the $500, all most airline reps will do is verify that they saw a receipt and mark the case as settled for $xxx.xx amount.  Separate pro tip: if you ever have any issues, like any issues at all, on a flight, stop by the airline office and just say that you had xyz difficulties and that you normally enjoy flying with said airline and is there anything they can do to make the next trip better.   9/10 times they will give you vouchers for various items available on the plane.
LPT: Make a distinct bend in your business card before dropping it in a bowl used for a drawing. The drawer is more likely to pick a card that sticks out rather than lays flat.*****My father showed me this trick by actually winning at a work function raffle. He said it works about 1 out of 10 times, which is still better than the odds when there is 50-100 cards in the bowl. Someone actually came up to him after the drawling and said, "you must be lucky, you always get selected." My father shot me a wink.
LPT: Don't "six months" yourself to death.*****This is a piece of advice my dad gave me over the weekend and I'd like to share it with you.   He has been working for a company for well over ten years. This is a large commercial real estate company and he manages a local property for them. He has been there over 10 years, and for the first few there were plans to develop the property into a large commercial shopping center. Those plans fell through and now the property owner is trying to attract an even larger client for the entire property.   However this attraction process is taking its dear sweet time. They keep telling him "six more months, six more months..." - that was about three years ago. Now the day to day drudgery is catching up to him and he's not happy. He recently interviewed for a position that would pay him almost triple his salary and would reinvigorate his love for his career.   So, the LPT is...don't wait. Don't keep telling yourself six more months. If you have an opportunity, take it. If you can create an opportunity, create it.   Grab life by the horns and shake!  Good luck!
LPT: Put a piece of clear tape over the speaker grill of kids toys that are way too loud in order to help dampen the volume. Helps prevent insanity!*****
LPT: Always greet someone by their name if you know it.*****This makes people feel more important and makes you instantly more likable, believe it or not. 
LPT: At a new job, if someone is showing you how to complete a task that you will need to repeat over and over, look up how to do it independently of their instructions. If they've been there a while, odds are they've developed shortcuts.*****Without doing it the long way, there's no way of understanding the process. If it all goes wrong, it will be your fault, even if the instructions you got were flawed.   
LPT: at work, when a new task comes up, use this rule: if it takes less than 5 minutes, do it right away. If it takes less than 20 minutes, do it right after your current task. If it takes longer than 20 minutes, schedule the task for later. You'll prevent a piling up of small tasks or forgetting.*****Yes, I know, this wouldn't work for every job. But for those who find it useful, I hope it helps.
LPT: When looking up recipes online, the recipe doesn't stop at the recipe. Read the reviews to find slight alterations (and frankly sometimes improvements) that fit your taste.*****EDIT: So what I'm getting here is the recipes are all wrong, the reviews are worse, God doesnt exist, dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria?
LPT request: How to not be such a procrastinating, lazy fuck*****This would really help alot... Thanks Let me add something onto that: how not to procrastinate
LPT: When memorizing a speech, memorize the main points instead of memorizing word for word.*****
LPT: if you’re staying in an Airbnb, scan the room with your phone camera at nighttime to check for hidden cameras. If there is one, the phone should pick up the infrared radiation light*****
LPT: When calling a company to complain, ask where to be directed 1st rather than explaining your situation right away with no pauses.*****Often the first person to answer is a receptionist/secretary whose job is to screen/transfer your call to the correct department, not handle each situation. You'll save yourself and the person on the other line some time and stress of repeating yourself by asking first rather than explaining only to hear "I'm sorry to hear that but let me transfer you to client services."  **thank you for the gold kind stranger. I understand this is common sense for the most part, and also applies to not just complaints.**
LPT: When you move somewhere new, specially if living alone, make a copy of your key to your residence and hide it or give it to someone trustworthy. Two dollars is cheaper than a locksmith if you lose the key.*****
